		<p>It&#8217;s a REALLY good list, not only because I&#8217;ve heard it from many other family members, friends, and nutritionists, but also because I&#8217;ve tried it and i feel much better! However, I must say i would like an everyday &#8220;meal&#8221; (kinda like an everyday menu i should eat every 3-4 hours for healthy teen-adults) rather than just separate types of food i can eat everyday. Also, I&#8217;d like to say that fish (most types) are VERY healthy because they are rich in many things. Well, still great list&#8230;</p>

		<p>This list is soo helpful! Thanks, I paid special attention to tomatoes because I recently found out that they are a superfood, in other words a food that will exponentially advance your vitamin intake.  The lycopene in tomatoes offers many minerals and vitamins.  Also, berries offer high amounts of folate and fiber. Simply by adding tomatoes or berries to your meal, you can increase the nutrition in your diet, but remember, these superfoods are NOT the only thing needed for healthy lifestyle.  Instead they are a great jumping board to a new healthy beginning.</p>
