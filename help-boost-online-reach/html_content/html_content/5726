		<h2>Here&#39;s A Sample Workout Schedule You Can Use To Lose 20 lbs...</h2>
	
		<p class="fo"><strong>Monday, Tuesday, Thursday &amp; Friday <span style="color: red">Mornings</span></strong></p>	
			
		<p>Do a 10-to-40 minute high intensity workout <a href="#20-work">by doing any of the workouts listed in #6 above</a> 
		and <em>If you're not in shape to do high intensity workouts...</em> <p id="xob">Start off doing 45-to-90 minute moderate intensity workouts like 

<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/weight-loss-calculators/walk40.htm">walking at a fast pace (&gt; 
4mph)</a> until you're ready to do high intensity workouts and you want to AVOID LOW intensity workouts like 
<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/weight-loss-calculators/walk20.htm">walking at a slow pace</a> 
because that will do almost nothing to help you lose 20 pounds as fast as 
			possible and...<br><br>
		<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/weight-loss-activity-calculator.htm">
			Any weight loss activity</a> can be a low, moderate, or high intensity workout depending on how much effort you put into it and
			<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/know-if-working-out-hard-enough-to-lose-weight.htm">You can go here to see if you're working out hard 
			enough to lose weight.</a></p> 

	<p class="fo"><strong>Monday, Tuesday, Thursday &amp; Friday <span style="color: red">Evenings</span></strong></p>			<p>Do another high intensity workout like you did on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday &amp; Friday morning 
				or... Just do another 45-to-90 minute moderate intensity workout.</p><p id="xob"><b>Tip:</b> 
				You're basically doing high intensity workouts 2 times a day, 4 times a week 
				<em>(Monday, Tuesday, Thursday &amp; Friday)</em> to lose 20 pounds as fast as possible but if that&#39;s too much for you... 
				<br><br>Start off only doing high intensity workouts 2 times a day, 2 times a week (like on Monday &amp; Thursday) and just do 45-to-90 minute moderate intensity workouts 
			on Tuesday &amp; Friday.</p>

			<p class="fo"><strong>Wednesday, Saturday &amp; Sunday <span style="color: red">Mornings &amp; Evenings</span></strong></p>				
<p>REST OR... Only do low or moderate intensity workouts on these days to allow 
your body to rest &amp; recover from the high intensity workouts and depending on 
how important it is that you lose weight whether it be for a wedding, reunion or 
any other important event...</p>
			<p><strong>It&#39;s highly recommended that you NOT REST</strong> and keep doing easier 
			lower-to-moderate intensity workouts like 	<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/weight-loss-calculators/walkall.htm">walking</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/weight-loss-calculators/runjogall.htm">jogging</a> 
			or 
	<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/weight-loss-calculators/bicycleall.htm">riding a bike</a> 
			for 45-to-90 minutes and...</p>
		<h3>How much weight will I lose doing all of this?</h3><p>The amount of weight you lose doing this plan mainly depends on 
		<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/Height_Weight_chart.htm">how overweight you are</a> so basically 
			the more overweight you are = the more weight you&#39;ll lose in 3-to-4 weeks on

			<li><b class="fo">If you&#39;re 20-to-50 lbs. overweight</b> - You 
			should seriously expect to lose 20 pounds and...</li>
			<li><b class="fo">If you&#39;re more than 50 lbs. overweight</b> - 
			You can probably lose 20 pounds on this plan without exercise but if 
			you truly have a weight loss emergency... It&#39;s best you exercise so

		</ul>
		
		<h4>You can maintain your weight after losing 20 pounds  by...</h4><ul id="z"><li>
			Staying active <i>(or not being lazy by...)</i> <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/weight-loss-activity-calculator.htm">Exercising</a>

				<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-get-motivation-to-lose-weight.htm">motivated enough</a> to put 
				in the effort to lose 20 pounds fast and...</li>
				<li>Since this plan is basically a 
				<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/very-low-calorie-diets-will-not-work.htm">Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD)</a> 
				- You should not stay on this for this plan for no longer than 
				4-to-8 weeks but in some cases...</li>
				<li>You may be able to stay on a VLCD like this for more than 
				4-to-8 weeks -
				<a href="http://www.nowloss.com/very-low-calorie-diets-will-not-work.htm">
				go here to see how you might be able to do this longer than

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-comment' ><p>Hi :)<br />
I'm 14 turning 15 in a few months. I weigh 125 lbs., not to mention my family is kind of big boned, And stand a little taller then 5'2". I know I'm not fat but being this short makes me look fatter. The thing is, I'm going down south to see family for part of the summer. Do you think 115 lbs is too small for a girl my age? Cause I want to be around a healthy weight and I want to be thinner, without looking anorexic. I also have a problem with my Jean size (size 6-7) and dress size (size 8-11) because I'm so short and because it (my height) makes me bigger. I play soccer in the fall and spring. I started working out a little more too. I have a huge problem with love handles, my stomach area, and my thighs. I'm not that worried about my legs though cause my upper body is bigger. Are there any good work outs that will help me lose weight in those areas? i've also almost considered starving myself but I know better and I also knew I wouldn't benifiet from it either. Thanks :)</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-comment' ><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I m 20 yrs old guy with 6ft height. I was thin till i was 11. It was due to a hierarchial problem of obesity which bought a sudden change in my physique. I jus grew in no time without my knowledge and by the time i was consicious i m at the edge of my teenage.. Now, i have 2 months time and i wanna reduce asap!!<br />
i have been hittin the gym but its like a seasonal one.. lik i go 30days regularly and have intensive workouts and the next 60days i dont!!<br />
Now, its too important for me to loose weight.. and i have a very good arms and shoulders. The much fat is at the belly and the tyres making my shirts too uncomfortable for me. Please do advise me an urgent excersise for my tyres( so that i can continue wearing all my shirts without goin for selected ones) and my belly and chest fat so that i can get back in atleast a good shape by 60 days. i don`t need to get a complete shape but atleast i want my self reduced to half!<br />
and this time i m gonna do it.. i dont mind even if i die working out but, i m gonna do this.. please show me a good road..</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-comment' ><p>Hello,<br />
I know you hear alot of people trying to lose weight and well I'm one of them. I'm 16 years of age and soon 17 next month, I weigh 153 and I'm about 5'4. I mostly have love handles and leg and butt fat. I really wanna get rid of the love handles and tone up my legs and butt. I wanna do it in a month and I'm beyond motivated to do it. Summer is coming up and I wanna have a beach body! I've had trouble with weight alot..When I was younger I was anorexic and I tried a plan to help me gain a little bit of weight but I gained too much! All I want to lose is 20 lbs and I know if I could do that then I could definately lose 10 more. 20 lbs isn't hard to lose I suppose but in the back of my head is the constant phrase "You can't do it Chelsea. You wont have a good body. EVER." But I do want a good bod.. I'm really self concious about myself and I constantly wear hoodies to make me look skinnier. Well, what I'm trying to get at is do YOU think I could do it in a month? I'm gonna try this plan out and I'm hoping.. wishing.. and praying this will work.. Thank you.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say that I have been following one of your routines and I have lost 30lbs in just 9 weeks. I am a 30yr old female with 3 kids (little one is only 4 months)and I went from 159 down to 129. I am 5'4" so this is my ideal weight. Now that my weight is under control I'd like to tone my arms and make my calves bigger because I have what some call "chicken legs". My thighs are a nice size, but my calves aren't. What exercise regimen do you recommend to tone and not bulk arms and to build muscle mass for legs, Thanks again...your AWESOME!!</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-comment' ><p>I am 29 and play rugby. I had shoulder surgery about 5 months ago. I was always an athlete and in great shape, but after the operation and being idle for several months, I put on a lot of weight. I ballooned to 201 lbs. Mind you, I am 5’7″. Less than four weeks ago (for Lent), I began a strict diet and workout plan – I am now 175.5 lbs. I have achieved this tremendous weight loss by going on a simple diet. I have removed meat, dairy, and all grains (rice, wheat, oats, etc.), butter, eggs, and alcohol from my diet. I drink two Myoplex protein shakes each day and eat as many fruits and vegetables as I want in between. I use olive oil when I cook potatoes and have some peanut butter on celery for some good fat. l have been running at least four times each week and lifting weights at the gym and physical therapy. I cannot vouch for the overall healthiness of this diet, but I feel great and am shocked at how much weight I have lost. It has taken quite a bit of will power, but the results have been worth it. I am looking forward to having a beer on Easter – I can tell you that – but I know that my eating habits have been changed for good. Good luck! If I can do it, anyone can!</p>

There is nothing in the world, IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, that is worth ruining your health for.<br />
Go for the long term diets, 6-10 pounds a month is more than enough.<br />
Some of you have been living with overweight for years, what is the urge to lose the weight in few weeks hein???? 6 months to one year time is good to lose and sustain the weight.<br />
Being able to slip 2-3 light desserts a week will make you feel less deprived and less prone to set backs.</p>
<p>Goodluck finding a healthy way...<br />
PS: HIT THE GYM 5 times a week!!! It's been working for meee!!!</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-reply' ><p>Hey Olivia! If I were you, as you being the parent, I would just make my children eat what I cooked. Growing up, I had ZERO taste buds for anything if it wasn't fruit loops, cheese pizza or macaroni and hotdogs. Kids have sensitive and underdeveloped taste buds because they just aren't developed yet. As we get older we start venturing out for more eventful and different flavors getting bored with just mac and cheese. You know what that did to me? Because my mother didn't have an iron grip, I was 160lbs in the 6th grade and weighed 260 my senior year. Get a firm grip and NEVER sacrifice your health for your children's taste buds. They need that type of food to prevent illnesses and nasty health problems when they are older. That is why I believe people are becoming shorter and shorter. Kids don't' drink milk, they don't eat meat or veggies and so on. It may sound rude, but as my old swedish grandmother would say "If you don't eat this then it's an empty tummy." Cooking can be easy. It just sounds to me that if it is too difficult for you to cook during the day, your children need to "relax" or be more disciplined so that they can occupy themselves. Of course, not so much for your two year old. Hope this helps :)</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-comment' ><p>HI.<br />
In the fall I'm going to be a freshmen in college. But before then I want to lose the weight that has been holding me back from fully enjoying life. I never felt comfortable in my body, and was always looking to lose weight fast. I'm about 5'5 and weigh close to 180. I would like to lose my belly, arm, and upper thigh fat fast. This summer I am dedicating to get in shape. Would this plan help me reach my goal of 130-145lbs, I want to lose around 35-50lbs.</p>
<p>Please, I need as much help as I can get.</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-reply' ><p>Hey roman! First of all, I want to say at 15 and 6"1 and wanting to get in shape like that, kudos to you man! As a female I am so tired of seeing men not care about their figures. The main reason why men gain belly fat is because their estrogen levels are too high. Things that boost TESTOSTERONE levels include weight resistance, extreme physical activities like boxing, sprinting and wrestling all boost testosterone levels. Also, eat meat for the protein to boost your fat burning levels. Don't be afraid of red meat either. Keep out the sugars, colas and alcohol as they all raise estrogen levels in men. And as i've learned, to target train, work your WHOLE body. ;) and grow your hair out too then give me a call ;)</p>

<p>A friend of mine has started doing Zumba and she loves it. She was always big but took it easy in the beginning and now she's an instructor and is "hooked". It looks really fun. Or, get off the bus one stop earlier on the way to school and play your favorite music on the IPod and power walk. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-reply' ><p>I really empathize with you Emily. My biggest advice is stay away from processed foods and sugars as much as possible. People go on diets and still drink gatorades because of the crock they make you believe about the electrolytes. Drink water with fresh squeezed lemon juice in it. It's got more electrolytes plus vitamin C and not even a quarter as many calories, artificial ingredients or sugars as gatorade. Plus, it revs metabolic rate and helps burn fat. A big thing I also suffered from was lack of motivation. but tell yourself this, "I am one tough ass bitch." Go to the gym, feel PROUD about being as young as you are and working hard. Go outside and run. Sweat, feel tough that you are getting stronger. I had to to. I hating working out because I was so weak and looked ridiculous. It unmotivated me. But think of yourself as a champion. Not many average people go out and do these things now. So feel proud of yourself with every jog, pushup and kick. :)</p>

Im a 23 year old guy, I weigh 255 pounds and I'm 6ft, so it pretty bad man. This last year I gained 33 pounds (since last summer) and I've really struggled to stop this increase. </p>
<p>I eat virtually no green stuff and unfortunatly do eat plenty of red meat and carbs etc. I work EXTREMLY long hours so not only do I not have time for gym, I also end up nibbiling on snacks at work. Can you recommend anything, I really to start losing ANYTHING, seriously losing 1 pound at this point would make me happy. Should I starve myself?!</p>

Thx for letting me know that I'm not by myself. It felt really good to read your reply and see that smeone's like me. I don't get it either.

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-reply' ><p>i am in the exact same predicament. the thing that i have been doing is cutting back. im not taking anything out of my diet, im just cutting down the amount that i eat. you dont have to completely cut out sugars and salts and fats. just limit the amount that you are eating each day. and really think about what you should be eating right before you eat. always ask yourself "do i really NEED this?". its helped me so far, and hopefully it will help you!<br />
as well, you should exercise! at least 30 mins a day. so go for a walk for 30 mins. but remember to have warm up and cool down time! its very important to do that.</p>

		<div id='a-c'  class='tb-comment' ><p>Hi. I am 155 pounds and 5 ft 5 in tall. My body isn't that bad, but I do have bigger love handles and belly fat. I really want to loose 25 to 30 pounds before summer. I have about 2 months to do so. I try to go to the gym but I work a lot. I need some tips on how to loose my belly fat and love handles quick. Thank you.</p>
