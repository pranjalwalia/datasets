<p>The following are 10 unconventional weight loss tips that worked for me.  Between January 4, 2006 and March 31, 2006 I lost fifty pounds.  These tips work well because almost every tip is focused around completing a small goal.  In my opinion, to stay motivated and lose a significant amount of weight, you should complete many goals in a short period of time.  The reason I call these tips unconventional is that I had not seen a majority of them before starting my diet.</p>
<p>I will start by recognizing the typical &#8220;calories in, calories out&#8221; schpeil.  Yes, to lose weight you have to eat well and exercise.  But there is much more to it than that, and I don&#8217;t want to spend time regurgitating ideas you&#8217;ve heard before.  That brings me to the first point:</p>
<p><strong>Buy a digital scale</strong><br />
This seems easy enough.  I recommend that before starting a diet, buy a scale that is accurate to .2 (two-hundredths of a pound).  I will explain why below.  I also recommend either buying a scale that can record your daily weight, or manually logging your weight everyday.  I bought a scale that was accurate to .2 and logged my weight at Sam&#8217;s Club for $22.  It has been a great investment.</p>
<p><strong>Weigh yourself everyday</strong><br />
You&#8217;ll find that almost every other dieter will tell you to weigh yourself only once a week.  I recommend the exact opposite.  I am very goal oriented and I like to see results everyday.  The reason I recommend buying a scale that is accurate to the .2 is that there is a very big difference between weighting 170.8 one day and 170.0 the next day.  Losing .8 pounds in one day is excellent.  However, if your scale is not accurate enough to report the loss and still shows 170 after a day of healthy eating and working out, you will feel extremely discouraged.  A more detailed scale makes it easier to keep a positive outlook.  The more successes (days with positive weight loss) the easier it is.</p>
<p><strong>Drink 8 glasses of water everyday</strong><br />
This one is obvious and broadly recommended, however, the reason I recommend it is slightly different.  Drinking eight glasses of water per day helps you &#8220;feel less hungry.&#8221;  I can&#8217;t prove this scientifically, however, when I am at work, I drink 4 cups in the morning and 4 cups in the evening.  On the days that I don&#8217;t drink the water, I feel hungrier, earlier.  Also, on the days I don&#8217;t drink water I feel sleepier, sooner.  Don&#8217;t feel intimidated by trying to drink 8 glasses of water.  Try doing what I do:  I have a pint glass I keep at work, it holds sixteen ounces (as all pint glasses do).  All I do is drink two pints of water in the morning and two in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Make your diet public</strong><br />
Tell people you&#8217;re on a diet.  There&#8217;s no reason to be ashamed to be on a diet.  I found that trying to keep my diet a secret was harder than just telling people.  In fact, telling your coworkers, girlfriend, family, etc. will increase your accountability.  It motivated me knowing that my coworkers and family knew that I was dieting because I did not want to fail.  I also chose a typical &#8220;fat picture&#8221; and put it on my fridge, in my cubicle, and on my wall.  I wanted to have a continual reminder to lose the weight.  I know it&#8217;s a cliche, but it was important for me to remind myself of my ultimate goal.</p>
<p>I feel I should also note that although I was 50 pounds over weight, when I told people I was on a diet they often said &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to diet.&#8221;  I found this surprising because I was obviously overweight.  Beware that you will likely hear similar comments.  I found it easier to just accept the &#8220;compliment&#8221; than to try to justify my diet to them.  Remember that you are on a diet for you, and that you do not need to justify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t diet on the weekends</strong><br />
This is another unconventional bit of advice.  I was able to lose 50 pounds without dieting on the weekends.  I found myself tired, depressed, and unmotivated if I tried to continue my diet into the weekend.  I felt that Friday and Saturday (my weekend) was a time to celebrate 5 days of dieting.  You may not find this necessary, especially in the first few weeks of a diet.  However, as many weeks passed, the weekend became a time for me to celebrate my weekly successes and get myself mentally prepared for another five days of dieting.  I considered it a mental recharge.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t sacrifice your life for your diet</strong><br />
On occasion, you will find yourself unable to eat healthy.  Whether this is because of lunches with your team at work, birthdays, or special occasions, there will be events that you just can&#8217;t (or don&#8217;t want to) eat healthy.  A diet will feel overwhelming if you have to sacrifice special events in your life.  The way I combated this was to exchange a day that I was not going to diet on the weekend.  In other words, if I didn&#8217;t diet on Tuesday, for example, I would diet on Saturday, instead.</p>
<p><strong>Make the small changes</strong><br />
This is a pretty common tip, however, I have a twist to it.  Rather than giving up what most diets say you should give up (soda, coffee, beer, caffeine, etc.) just make healthier decisions.  I didn&#8217;t want to give anything up, so I decided to make some changes instead.  The first switch I made was switching to diet soda.  Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll quickly get used to the flavor.  Before I started my diet, I swore I would never drink diet soda.  Now thanks to my girlfriend, diet is the only soda I drink.   The second switch I made was to drinking black coffee.  Cut out the sugar and creme, and you get the benefits of coffee (caffeine) without the calories.  The last major switch I made was to &#8220;healthy&#8221; beer.  I&#8217;m a Miller Lite drinker, however, by temporarily switching  to Beck&#8217;s Premier Light (60 calories per serving) I was able to still enjoy a healthy social life while maintaining my diet.</p>
<p>In addition to making the small changes in your diet, make the small changes in your life: park further away, walk to the end of the train platform and get in the last car, and vow not to take an elevator for an entire week.  I also found it advantageous to wear a pedometer and try to compete against myself for how far I could walk in a single day.  The furthest I walked in a day was 6.5 miles.  I voluntarily walked to work twice a week.</p>
<p><strong>Gain perspective by understanding the fractions</strong><br />
Your diet is an incredibly small fraction of your life.  If you live for 80 years, and dieted for four months, that would only be  .42% of your life.  That&#8217;s right, if you diet for four months, it will be less than one half of one percent of your life.  On the other hand think of the major benefits you can get from .42% of your life.  If it helps you stay motivated, count down the days starting at 120.</p>
<p><strong>Rationalize your workouts</strong><br />
Finding the time to get to the gym can be very difficult.  However a 1/2 hour workout is only 2% of your day (assuming 24 hour days).  For me, the most motivating thought was comparing my workouts to sitcoms.  As a huge Everybody Loves Raymond fan, every time I would sit down to watch an episode, I would remind myself that in the 1/2 hour that I was sitting and doing nothing, I could complete my daily workout.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve lost the weight, what now?</p>
<p><strong>Have a red flag weight</strong><br />
Once you&#8217;ve lost the weight, you need to keep it off.  This is where the red flag comes in.  You need to pick a weight and vow to never get heavier than it again.  It is normal for your body to fluctuate five to ten pounds.  I recommend picking a weight that is ten pounds heavier than what you &#8220;normally&#8221; weigh and never weigh more than it again.  Setting a red flag weight allowed me to keep off every pound for over 1 year.</p>
<p>Lastly, for the curious out there&#8230;I followed the Weight Watchers diet.  I did not pay for the diet, nor did I go to meetings.  I found out all the information about the diet on-line.  The first place to look is at their <a href="http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6663564&#038;id=1YYNAAAAEBAJ&#038;dq=weight+watchers">patent</a>.</p>
<p>All well known diets are available via <a href="http://www.google.com/patent" title="Google Patent Search Link">Google Patent Search</a>.  For the several months that I was dieting, I also gave up red meat and made sure to drink a lot of milk.  The preceding tips worked perfectly for me and they will work for you, too.  Prior to creating my own diet plan, I tried to diet several times and failed every time. I swear by these weight loss tips.  What do you think of them?  Do you have a tip that didn&#8217;t make my list?  Let us know in the comments.  I will be glad to answer any questions or defend any point.</p>

<p>I heartily agree with your ideas although I could practice the water bit much better.</p>
<p>I have also lost wait and kept it off and found that substitutions like your diet soda example have been key.  Here is a list:</p>
<p>Hot tea with artificial sweetener as well as diet soda</p>
<p>La Tortilla Factory Whole Wheat Low Carb/Low Fat Tortillas for bread (only 50 cal w/8 g fiber)</p>
<p>Caesar salads (I like Cardini&#8217;s light) with canned salmon (wild &#8211; no farmed), canned chicken, or even canned turkey have become lunch staples for me instead of sandwiches</p>
<p>the biggest challenge has been to stop eating candy, cookies, and ice cream.  here is what I substitute there:</p>
<p>Slim Fast Optima Milk Chocolate or Chocolate Royale shakes (190 cal)</p>
<p>Dark Chocolate (at least 70% Cocoa) just as satisfying although not nearly as sweet but lower in calories.</p>
<p>Luna (yes I know their for women!) Chocolate Peppermint Stick Protein Bars (180 cal) or 1/2 of a Promax Energy Bar either Chocolate Mint or Double Fudge Brownie (1/2 bar is 140 cal)</p>
<p>Cutting out as much bread as possible was key for me.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-128243" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;ve been on a diet since last october. In 2005 I was treasurer of a students association, a full time job which often involved staying late and eating pizza at the office or drinking too much beer after a day&#8217;s work. I weighed 75kg for a 1.73m frame &#8211; not terribly bad BMI wise, but&#8230; A fat test I took rated me at 26% fat &#8211; which is considered dangerously obese, no matter how good your BMI is.</p>
<p>So I decided to lose it. Before I was a student I weighed just 60kg and I wanted to weigh that again. I gave myself 6 months to attain that, which ends March 1st. I&#8217;m now 61.5kg so I&#8217;m close, but the last stretch is always the hardest.</p>
<p>I based my diet on the Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle ebook which is basically a Zone Diet variation, but with a lot of added information about how the body works and how nutrition works. I think this was the most important part for me personally: I now understand how proteins, carbs and fat work for my body. I understand what my metabolism does. This means that I can look at a nutrition label and understand if a product is good for me, which is often the exact reverse of what it says on the package (take a look at the label for almost anything that says &#8220;0% fat!&#8221; and check out the amount of sugar in it). I really recommend the ebook!</p>
<p>Some practical tips: I have a SIGG aluminum waterbottle, like those used by hikers, which I carry in my bag all the time. It&#8217;s a 0.6l bottle and I want to drink 3l a day, so I know I have to finish the bottle 5 times daily. This works with any easy container you can carry around, I just prefer the SIGG since it doesn&#8217;t leak over my laptop.</p>
<p>Every time you open the fridge door, ask yourself one question: Why am I doing this? If it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re hungry, my-body-needs-sustenance hungry, go ahead and eat. No problem. But if it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re just bored, want something to do, feel the need to snack, close that door and walk away.</p>
<p>Also check out the Hacker&#8217;s Diet, not for it&#8217;s dieting advice which is basically sound yet far too simplistic for my tastes (it skips over all nutrition aspects and considers every calorie the same), but for it&#8217;s Excel sheets. It has some great sheets with macros that can calculate your weighted average trend line from your daily weigh-ins. Knowing your trend-line is a far better motivational tool than just the weigh-ins, which can fluctuate up and down by several kilos. This also gives you more information than the &#8216;red flag&#8217; weight, since your trend line will be telling you you&#8217;re gaining weight long before you hit that dreaded flag &#8211; and the sooner you fix it, the better.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-128349" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>great tips. I had to write a comment as I saw a lot of things I did few months ago.<br />
I never had a weight problem and I didn&#8217;t really have serious problem also, just a tendency to keep gaining weight since we moved to US. Anyway, I decided to attack it straight forward and set a goal of loosing 15 pounds in three months.<br />
I did not eat more then one meal a day, most of the days I would just take plain cookies 2 every 2 hours. I drank water of course, but then I do that anyway.<br />
I also rested over weekends from my diet, went to parties and barbecues.<br />
I think most important thing was having a digital scale, I would do measurements through the day and see how weight oscillate.<br />
I got to the goal very quickly, in 5 weeks and it wasn&#8217;t that hard. I think this is probably one of better ways to lose excess weight as it is not painful. Of course in the beginning it goes fast, then it slows to a crawl.</p>
<p>Oh one thing. That diet sodas, come on people that is sad. Just don&#8217;t drink any soda. It is like smoking light cigarettes.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Zeljko Dakic</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-128364" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Some thoughts:</p>
<p>1. Be careful interpreting your weight from day to day.  A change of 0.8 pounds could easily be food you ate (or just passed).  If your body works on a good cycle from one day to the next, be sure to weigh yourself at the same point in that cycle.  Clothes weigh a lot too.</p>
<p>2. An easy way to keep yourself drinking water is to have some of it at your desk all day.  Our public water doesn&#8217;t taste that great, so I have some bottles of water that I keep stocked up on and I easily go through 1-2 liters or more a day at my desk just because it&#8217;s convenient.  (If that doesn&#8217;t appeal to you because you don&#8217;t have a mini-fridge in your office, try drinking it room temperature.  It&#8217;s really not that bad.)</p>
<p>3. The biggest problem I always had with finding time to exercise was setting unrealistic rules and then giving up when I inevitably broke them.  Set realistic rules, like maybe only exercising 4 days a week instead of 5, but try for 5 anyway.  If you are in a foul mood one day and skip a day, you&#8217;re not &#8220;off track&#8221; and you don&#8217;t get discouraged from going back the day after.  Exercising that 1 extra day also makes you feel like you&#8217;re doing better than you expected, which is a nice bit of positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>3a. If exercising seems like a chore, find a way to turn it into a routine that you can ignore, just like walking to the bus or driving to work.  If it becomes a regular part of your life, you&#8217;ll stop focusing on it as something &#8220;new&#8221; that you should give your attention to.  Make a point to avoid looking at the clock.  I accomplished this by giving myself a distraction.  I found a TV show that was on for an hour at the same time every day, and made myself an avid watcher while I worked out.  Once it becomes a routine, it&#8217;s easier to keep going.</p>
<p>4. Candy acts like an addiction.  I used to have mini candy bars at/near my office, and I would eat them all the time.  I&#8217;d frequently have desserts at restaurants.  When I started trying to eat healthier, I made a point to cut these out of my diet.  After a few months, I found that I didn&#8217;t crave sweets at all anymore, and it&#8217;s much easier to pass on desserts.</p>
<p>4a. One of the easiest ways to avoid eating bad food at home is to not buy it in the first place.  Avoid shopping when you&#8217;re hungry and make your &#8220;is this a want or a need&#8221; decisions at the grocery store where you can only be tempted once, instead of your kitchen, where the temptation is always there.  If you don&#8217;t own any Twinkies, it&#8217;s harder to binge on them.  (But do give yourself some sort of snack food.  Again, be realistic and don&#8217;t set yourself up to fail.)</p>
<p>Sorry for the length of my comment!  Your tips are good.  I just wanted to add a few things that helped me personally.</p>

<p>Join SparkPeople.com &#8211; it has TONS of tools, personalized meal plans and fitness plans, community boards, articles etc.  It&#8217;s all free and has actually been fun to use for me, so I look forward to that aspect of dieting.  It&#8217;s the sort of information I would expect to pay for from a company such as Weight Watchers or Jenny Craig.</p>
<p>Do your best to track your calories or, if you&#8217;re not that meticulous, keep a food journal where you write down everything you put in your mouth.  EVERYTHING.  Even if you keep the journal private, just writing it down on paper makes you face your food intake head on and it&#8217;s often a shock how much we underestimate our food consumption.  It can be the wake-up call you need.</p>
<p>Even if you have one or two non-diet days per week, I think it should be noted not to go completely overboard on these days otherwise you will undo all your hard work.  Maybe eat the foods you want that are off-limits while dieting, but still keep your portions under control.</p>

<p>I eat pretty much what I want (chocolate, pizza) but 5 days out of 7 I eat healthy with the Rule of The Plate (Mercedes logo rule):<br />
* Look at your plate, you should have the following proportions:<br />
1/3 fibers (veggies, fruit, grain),<br />
1/3 protein (lentils, fish, poultry, meat; alternate every day!),<br />
1/3 carbs.  </p>
<p>If you can see your food like this, you have a healthy, balanced plate.  No more huge spaghetti extravaganza, need to put some meat and some veggies in there!<br />
* Feel the need for a soda instead of drinking plain water?  Get a soda club machine, and fizz your own water.<br />
* Never eat 4 hours before going to bed (someone mentionned 7pm).<br />
* Feel hungry for a snack? Drink a big glass of COLD water. Still feel hungry for a snack? Go for it.</p>
<p>Follow these simple rules, it works for a lifetime!</p>

I avoided meat and sweets. I tried to eat no more than 1000-1500 calories per day. I drank tea/water until it didn&#8217;t help killing hunger, only then I ate. NEVER ate until feeling full! I drank a good gulp of tea/water (whatever that has no calories) after every bite of food. Had breakfast as late as possible. Had last meal as early as possible. Got used going to bed a little hungry. Tried to eat more vegetables and fruit instead of cheese, bread, etc.. Did push-ups and sit-ups every morning and evening and sometimes during the day. Eventually I got so used to those exercises that felt bad if I sometimes didn&#8217;t to them in the morning. And I ate &#8216;bad&#8217; food only on weekends, too. I went from 117 kilos to 74 (lowest registered).  The sad thing is, I could not handle it after some time. Now I am gaining weight back. And it is damn hard to start loosing weight again. I fail every day or two. Gonna try gym this time :)</p>

<p>So I decided to go on a diet, and in three months, I lost that 30 pounds. I gave up all dairy, meat (except fish), and many carbs. I kept my blood sugar up by eating very small amounts of candy.</p>
<p>For me, the thing that bothered me wasn&#8217;t being hungry &#8211; it was the light-headedness and nausea that came with it.</p>

If you want to eat something after 7pm, have some protein, which actually revs up your metabolism.  As far as bread goes.  I don&#8217;t eat any white and all whole wheat is eaten before dinner.  And if you&#8217;re craving sweets, just have them immediately after you workout.  At this time, its actually important to spike your blood sugar to get nutrient rich blood to flood the muscles.  Just make sure not to overdue it and to also include high quality protein.  I.E. have a chicken salad or post workout shake and allow yourself a bit of chocolate for dessert; the key being moderation.  Also weekends off is the greatest idea ever.  This is what allows me to maintain such a strict regiment throughout the week and also provides me with an opportunity to increase glycogen stores in order to have some kick-ass workouts throughout the week.</p>

I&#8217;ve been using my own variation of it and it has been working well for me.  Although, I had much farther to got.  I&#8217;ve lost about 70 pounds and I have roughly 60 more to go.  </p>
<p>I totally agree on weighing yourself every day.  For me, it helps me keep focused on losing.  I also made a deal with myself that I wasn&#8217;t going to &#8220;freak out&#8221; if I have set back.  Set backs will happen, but its no big deal.    Once I recognize the setback I can always get myself back on track.</p>
<p>I have also taken the perspective that there is no food that I &#8220;can&#8217;t have&#8221;.  I allow myself to indulge from time to time.  Although, I&#8217;m intrigued by your &#8220;weekend celebration&#8221; idea.  I will have to give that some thought.</p>

Right down to the .2 increment scale, weighing every day, not giving up anything that I like and even quickly getting used to diet soda. If you hadn&#8217;t mentioned that you drink beer, I&#8217;d swear I wrote this&#8230; seriously&#8230; it&#8217;s that accurate to my own regimen.</p>
<p>As of this morning 16.2 pounds shed since the first of the year and I just finished off a heaping bowl of chocolate Lucky Charms. How&#8217;s that for diet food? </p>
<p>To hell with all of the diet plans out there. It&#8217;s 100% about calories&#8230; burn more than you eat. Very simple math. The wider that gap is, the more weight you lose. There are other reasons to change how you eat, but if you&#8217;re strictly speaking of weight loss, you could eat McDonald&#8217;s cheeseburgers and fries and lose weight, as long as you burned more than you consumed.</p>
<p>The biggest difference for me was in cutting out regular soda. I happened to want to break the caffeine addiction as well, so I don&#8217;t drink any soda now. Took about 2 days of having a stiff, but tolerable headache and I was through it. Pick a rainy weekend, buy some OTC drugs and get out of that caffeine rut. I must admit, I can wake up and function a LOT easier in the morning now. The snooze bar rarely sees action, and I used to wear that thing out!</p>

<p>As far as dieting goes, I think one thing that works for me is. If you want a cookie&#8230;eat a damn cookie. If you constantly deny yourself what you want or crave, eventually your body is going to give in x&#8217;s 100 and instead of having 1 cookie you are going to eat a whole bag.</p>

<p>I feel I did all the tips (Oh man the Diet soda&#8230;Weekends break:D!) you did, and I must say they helped so much to make me lose about 80 pounds over a year!<br />
Maybe it took me a while, but I know myself, and I have a feeling that if you lose wieght quickly you will gain it again quickly. The habbits and the behavior that you have change, and that takes time.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-128922" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I also did a lot of the things you mentioned when I went on my diet and they did help. About three years ago, I sacrificed 6 months and dropped roughly 60lbs.</p>
<p>Other things I recommended and/or did:<br />
1.) Stay away from carbs. I gave up rice on the weekdays (I&#8217;m Asian..not easy). Instead of two slices of bread for a sandwich, I would use one slice (not folded&#8230;so it would seem like a lot). </p>
<p>2.) Spread your meal. For a few months of my diet, I used to eat protein/health bars as a substitute for breakfast/lunch (some ppl may not approve). Instead of eating the whole thing at once, I typically broke into three pieces or paced finishing it throughout the morning. Same thing for dinner…if I had soup or sandwich, I typically divided it and ate it at two separate times.</p>
<p>3.) Make it seem like exercise is something you have to do daily, like taking a shower, commuting to work, eating, pooping, etc. Treat it like that mandatory weekly staff meeting, that you can never miss. It should not feel like an optional activity or added chore, but more of a routine that you can’t live without. </p>
<p>4.) Distract yourself while you exercise, life goes a lot faster. Watch television, throw on that IPOD, talk to somebody on the phone, read a book…or even pace yourself behind the cute girl jogging. When you start thinking about the pain, or counting down the minutes left on the treadmill clock, time moves even slower and it starts feeling like a chore again. </p>
<p>5.) Make a competition of it, set goals, realistic deadlines and give yourself rewards. I find that I work harder when I’ve got some kind of competition, even if it’s against myself. For example, when running the track, if somebody else was on the track, I’d try to outpace that person or overlap him, or try my best to not let him pass me up. If I went to the gym with a buddy, I’d try to push more weight, run one extra lap, or do one extra set of sit-ups than him. If I was watching a show, I’d make it a goal to run at a quick pace until each commercial…etc. </p>
<p>6.) Like it says at the top, make substitutions. I also replaced soda with diet soda. I used nonfat milk instead of regular milk. I gave up ketchup and stuck to mustard (0 Calories). I went to fat free mayo, chips, and yogurt. After awhile, you can’t really tell the difference between a lot of the fat free, low fat and regular products. I walked to the gym or to the market instead of driving. If you eat a lot one day, make it up on the weekend.</p>
<p>7.) I sorta agree with the “Don’t give up your life” But how about…sometimes be fashionably late. There are those days or weeks where its every1s bday dinner/party or maybe its xmas time and you have all those parties you have to go to. You can avoid a lot of the food and still enjoy by coming in fashionably late. The meal is typically the first thing to take place anyway, so usually you don’t miss much.</p>
<p>8.) Keep yourself busy and away from the kitchen or snack drawer. I find that when you&#8217;re home and sitting around, you have more chances of heading into that kitchen or snacking. If I needed to study, I went to the library or studied with somebody. During my work breaks, I would take naps instead of eating. Talk to somebody while you eat, the waiter will take away your plate before you know it.</p>

I am sent a few dieting newsletters and it gets old to read the same three bits of advice over and over.  Ceasar salads ARE the best! I lost 50 pounds a few years ago.  My MAIN source of weight loss was excercise.  I worked out a lot, at least an hour a day &#8211; and lifted weights twice a week. In the beginning I was tired after 10 minutes on the treadmill, by three months I was running for 40 minutes easily.  Putting lots of effort into working out, just makes you think twice about what you put into your mouth.  I still ate almost anything I wanted, but not as often and SMALL portions.  Like I said before, cesear salads with chicken or seafood, tuna sandwiches and toast with sliced tomato and cream cheese (drizzled with balsamic vinegar) became breakfast, lunch and dinner quite frequently.  Good luck to all. It is SO WORTH IT to bust your butt to look and feel your best. Your life changes totally and you finally feel in full control of yourself.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-128989" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi and well done,</p>
<p>I am following a low-carb diet (<a href="http://www.tonyferguson.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tonyferguson.com/</a>) with great success.  I am averaging 2-3kg (4.4-6.6lbs) per week.  And I have done stuff all exercise too (some bad foot pain which is being addressed but not fixed yet being the main culprit).</p>
<p>My wife is also on the diet and is averaging 1-2 kg (2.2-4.4lbs) per week.  (Sorry, generally men can lose weight easier than women.  Plus I have a lot more to lose to start with&#8230;)</p>
<p>One of the main differences is that there are no days off (but it is not so painful).  The idea of this diet is to put your body into a fat burning mode called ketosis.  Having a day or two off would kick your body out of that mode and it takes two or three days to get back into it.</p>
<p>The high water intake is good.  I have to drink 2 litres (4.2 pints) per day, no caffeine or alcohol.  The water helps my kidneys flush out the fat, and the caffiene, etc helps retain fat, so out they go.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of the diet I&#8217;ve found are:</p>
<p>- Two meals a day are taken care of for you with replacement meals, so you only have to think about one meal a day.</p>
<p>- You can have meat regularly.</p>
<p>- I&#8217;ve found that after the first couple of weeks with coming down off the coffee or sugar it has been not too much of a chore.</p>
<p>I like your red flag weight idea, and will adopt it once I&#8217;m at my goal.</p>
<p>I also like your understanding the fractions rational too, however you should take into account that a half hour gym work-out also includes driving to/from the gym, getting changed before and after, post work-out shower, etc, so is more like an hour.</p>
<p>Also, if you can&#8217;t afford or dislike the gym, the best exercise for fat loss is walking.  It is not the best for body toning or such, but if you are concentrating on fat loss, walking is best.  Cycling and/or swimming are other alternatives (although not as good as the walking because the cycle or water is supporting your weight instead of your legs).  Basically getting your heart-rate up for 20-40 minutes a day is a good thing.</p>
<p>In addition to measuring your weight, you may also want to take a weekly measurement around your waist (belly-button level) and log that.</p>
<p>Doing you measurements at the same time of the day every time is a good thing I think.  For me it is first think in the morning, post toilet, pre eating or drinking anything (I figure that is my lightest point in the day).</p>
<p>One thing no one has mentioned so far is that you should probably talk your planned dietary methods over with your doctor.  There&#8217;s plenty of bad and conflicting advice about diets out there.  Some things could impact your health in detrimental ways you don&#8217;t expect.</p>
<p>You also need to find what works for you as everyone is different.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my two cents:</p>
<p>Drink tons of water when you&#8217;re sitting down, about to have your meal. Drink at least 2-3 full cups so that you&#8217;re full with water. Wait until everyone has already begun eating, then slowly, take tiny little bites- remembering to maintain drinking water in between bites. By the time everyone is done eating, you will have only eaten 5 tiny bites and a stomach full of water/food. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not big on drinking water, eat lots of watermelons or fruits high in water before you sit down for your actual meal. Trust me, I lost about 15lbs in 1 and a half weeks. Goodluck all!</p>
<p>PS: Jogging a very very slow pace for about 30 min a day (and keeping up with the above intake strategy) will guarantee your weight loss.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-129117" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;d like to comment on some of the comments that came after my first comment:</p>
<p>Diet soda. If you&#8217;re addicted to soda, the first step is dropping down to diet soda. I needed this step for 3 months (I was extremely addicted to caffeine). The next step is dropping it entirely. I don&#8217;t care about Aspartame and if it&#8217;s bad for you, honestly, if you need it, go ahead. But what bothered me is that chemically, it&#8217;s just like sugar. It doesn&#8217;t get stored like sugar, but it makes your body react just like sugar. You drink a (diet) coke, your blood sugar spikes, your insuline level spikes and woohoo &#8211; fat gets stored directly just like that. Don&#8217;t like that? Stop drinking that diet coke. Water is really nice.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy shit you don&#8217;t want to eat. I stopped buying chips and french fries &#8211; voila, I stopped gorging myself on them. If you don&#8217;t have them, you can&#8217;t eat them.</p>
<p>Some commentors like to skip meals or eat only once a day. I wouldn&#8217;t do that. Your body uses a lot of calories when it&#8217;s working its way through meals &#8211; that&#8217;s called metabolism. You want to use that. If you can eat more often (yet smaller portions overall) thats a good thing. Keep your metabolism up. The best is if you can manage to eat 6 meals a day (that way, each meal arrives just as the previous one is finished processing, keeping your metabolism going), but I barely manage 5 meals a day. More, yet smaller = better.</p>
<p>Counting your calories (and your macros, ie your protein/carb/fat percentages) is good. Don&#8217;t get obsessed by them, but realize what they mean and what they do. If you eat too much one night, accept this (you&#8217;re just human, after all) and either diet to compensate or accept you&#8217;ll go slightly up. Don&#8217;t fall off the wagon over just one time. Failing one night doesn&#8217;t mean you need to stop dieting &#8211; it just means you need to diet a tiny bit harder over the spread of the next few months.</p>
<p>And just FYI, your body has been honed by evolution to have a feature called starvation. If you starve your body, it just goes into an ultra-efficient mode where it burns as little fat as possible and starts using muscle as an energy-source &#8211; since having less muscle means you won&#8217;t be using as much energy as previously. It&#8217;s highly efficient &#8211; and it&#8217;s exactly what you don&#8217;t want. Don&#8217;t starve yourself.</p>
<p>Last, if you&#8217;re really serious, find some way to test your fat percentage (but not one of those digital scales, since they&#8217;re not very accurate). It&#8217;s really the only way to know if you&#8217;re improving your body, or if you&#8217;re just burning just as much muscle as you&#8217;re burning fat. I made this mistake and found out too late that i was burning just as much muscle as I was burning fat. I&#8217;m much lighter now, but my body hasn&#8217;t improved as much as i wanted&#8230; my bad.</p>

<p>I did the same thing as you did maybe 2-3 years ago and I came up with the same solutions myself!</p>
<p>Now I excersise 3 times a week and have one day a week when I can eat anything I want. And it&#8217;s working great! I almost have a six-pack by now! unbelivable what slow but steady effort can do.</p>

One that I might add is to commute by bike if you are in a metro area and if not try to add some kind  of physical activity that you know can be added without taking away from an already busy schedule.</p>

<p>The small things really make all of the difference- stairs, parking further, etc.</p>
<p>One suggestion that I have for the extremely lazy(like myself) is to start your excersize routine by just walking around more often.  If you&#8217;re bored, walk!  </p>
<p>Even a five minute walk on a break or after dinner- the extra time invested will definetly add up.  If you think it won&#8217;t, just remember that the extra time walking is less time doing nothing!</p>
<p>And if you can&#8217;t find the energy to jog, try riding a bicycle instead.  And always remember that the time invested is more important than the intensity of the workout.  </p>
<p>Ofcourse, you won&#8217;t see results after your first venture around the block&#8230; Don&#8217;t let that discourage you, or let yourself think that it was a waste of time-  Think about how much better you&#8217;ll look in a month!</p>

This time I will be implementing the &#8220;weekends off&#8221; policy you enforced. I also know I need a new scale, so thanks for that push in the rear. I have 30 pounds I want to lose by July, and now I have renewed hope that it IS possible! Thanks, again. (I will be linking to this on my own blog)</p>

<p>Oh, and the reason Beck&#8217;s Premium Light is half the calories of other beers is because it&#8217;s half the alcohol&#8230;so if you&#8217;re trying to catch a buzz you&#8217;ll have to drink twice as much, which will actually amount to more calories.  But it&#8217;s a good tip if you&#8217;re just out having a couple with friends. </p>

<p>I love the book &#8220;Body Clutter&#8221; by flylady &#8211; who recommends weighing yourself every day and keeping track of your weight &#8211; which is &#8220;just a number&#8221;&#8230;and she stresses that you&#8217;re not your number.  It helped me stop feeling that my identity was in my weight that day &#8211; and if I gained a pound, I was still the same great person. (as I will be as I lose 54.5 pounds soon, I hope)</p>
<p>I also drink a lot of water.  It helps so much!  I agree with you on the fact that it helps keep you from getting tired as much.</p>
<p>GREAT idea to take weekends off!</p>
<p>What has been working for me is making a 30-minute walk in the morning part of my routine.  I had to miss it one day this week and found I missed the walk &#8211; that my day didn&#8217;t feel right without it!  </p>
<p>I also eat when hungry &#8211; and eat until satisfied&#8230;usually when my body gives that little &#8220;sigh&#8221; that tells me I&#8217;ve had enough.  (sometimes I tend to push on with a few more bites but then I get too full)</p>
<p>I eat as much fresh foods as possible..and choose whole dairy products (versus low fat) which shocks some friends but I&#8217;m eating small amounts of some rich foods &#8211; and am satisfied with very little.  The whole milk has fat in it that keeps me full longer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lost 12 pounds so far and look forward to losing the rest!</p>
<p>My goal in losing weight is not to become a fabulous new person but to feel more like &#8220;me&#8221; again&#8230;and comfortable in my body.</p>
<p>I love your article and will print it out and post it at home and in the office!!</p>

<p>Another tip I wanted to add: Change your thinking about exercising as an &#8220;optional&#8221; activity. </p>
<p>I see so many comments above about &#8220;finding time&#8221; to exercise. You don&#8217;t find time to eat, or sleep, or use the bathroom, you just do those things because they have to be done (even when you&#8217;re busy). Approach exercise the same way &#8212; schedule a time to do it each day, then build your day around it. If things come up, it&#8217;s the other items that need to get rearranged &#8212; NOT your daily workout. </p>
<p>Congrats on your achievement.</p>

<p>Stay away from high fructose corn syrup (its in everything&#8230; beer, ketchup, cereal, soda) and MSG (in a ton of stuff too&#8230; Tuna, potato chips, soups)</p>
<p>Both HFSC and MSG mess with your pancreas (ie. insulin production).  Its why westerners are fat.</p>

<p>&gt; Always weigh at the same time everyday as weight fluctuates (cycles) during the day.</p>
<p>&gt; Try to wear similar clothes when weighing as clothes weigh more than you might expect.  If you are measuring tenths of a pound then it will make a difference.</p>
<p>&gt; Something often overlooked is getting adequate sleep.  I find that when I am tired I crave/eat food when what I actually need to do is get to bed.  Also, sleeping helps pass the dieting hours &#8211; I&#8217;ve never found myself eating while asleep!</p>

<p>One niggle though &#8211; your body weight will naturally fluctuate over the period of a day. Factors such as food and water ingested and salt intake can change your wait by more than a pound over a day.</p>
<p>For instance if you drink a litre of water you add one kilo to your body weight straight away. Using scales that accurate on a daily basis will not detect changes in body fat and may give the impression you&#8217;ve gained weight when you haven&#8217;t.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-130653" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The water tip is EXTREMELY important. Not only does having water make you feel more full, but being dehydrated makes me unable to feel really full. If I&#8217;m dehydrated, I can eat enormous amounts of food without the stuffed feeling kicking in. Dehydration also makes me crave sweets. </p>
<p>I discovered this after a year of frequent flying, when I always seemed to be unable to control my eating while away from home. The reason? Flying is incredibly dehydrating. </p>
<p>So drink water while you&#8217;re flying, drink water once you get there, and keep drinking lots of water for the first 24 hours after you get there. It&#8217;ll make a huge difference. Plus, of course, as recommended, drink at LEAST eight glasses of water a day. I recommend eight 16-ounce glasses a day, twice the normal recommendation.</p>

<p>great tips.</p>

<p>- Loose the meat, replace with FISH.<br />
- Loose SOFTDRINKS and CHOCOLATE.<br />
- When ever you can, eat fruits and green&#8217;s.<br />
- Drink plenty of water.<br />
- Always eat more at lunch than at dinner.<br />
- Loose the MILK,  and any cream-based food.<br />
- Study the contents of what you buy in the store, you&#8217;ll be surprised. Especially look out for the hidden suger.<br />
- Cut down on the BREAD, and loose the WHITE BREAD all together.<br />
- Be very careful with food that has a fat content of more than 5%.<br />
- Never add fat to the meals, if you do, use olive oil.<br />
- And of course, no eating out the first 5-10 weeks. </p>
<p>And remember that if (example) you&#8217;re a dude and over 6&#8243; tall, you still have to eat a whole lot of food to get by, especially if you&#8217;ve started with any physical exercises.</p>

I&#8217;ve been on Weight Watcher&#8217;s 3 times in the last 3 years. My last attempt was in June of 2006. I lost 6 pounds in 12 weeks and this didn&#8217;t even help me drop a size in clothing. I do drink water naturally all day long. I also find it helpful to write everything down that I eat. I exercise as well. The hardest challenge is not eating after 7pm.<br />
I&#8217;m currently back to dieting since I gained the 6 pounds back and more. In 2 weeks, I&#8217;ve managed to gain, not loose. I am firm believer that everyone is different and weight loss is more challenging for some than others.<br />
Thanks again. I hope to learn something new here that will help me continue on my weight loss journey.</p>

I&#8217;ve lost 10 pounds so far in 8 weeks with just 5 more to go. I feel like I&#8217;ve plateaued at 132 and I was experiencing extreme cravings today for wings and cheesecake. I told a friend and he suggested that maybe my body was letting me know that I should stop dieting. Any comments? I don&#8217;t feel skinny yet, but I don&#8217;t want to be obsessive either. I&#8217;ve been eating 1300 to 1400 calories per day.</p>

I also chose to walk alone because i could keep the pace with the music and not have to slow down tryin to answer questions to someone who wanted to talk. I hope this suggestion works as it did for me, i thought of the one thing &#8220;i was not going to become a victim of Diabetes&#8221;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-156846" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I an a proffesional fitness trainer and after reading your tips i was very disturbed.<br />
 First of all every single person who goes on a &#8220;diet&#8221; fails to loose weight long term and fails go be healthier. Healthy is a lifestyle it is nothing that can be done in a few months but takes a life long commiyment to stay fit and healthy, that is why in the big picture weighing yourself everyday can lead to a lot of false fustration exspecially in women which can easily flucuate 10-15 during there menstral cycle.<br />
Eatling right and staying fit is a life commitment which cannot be ignored on weekends because it is a lifestyle. Drinking diet soda is worse than drinking the real thing. The next time you go to the supernarket look at what other people have in there carts. Fat people always have the products labled as &#8220;diet&#8221; &#8220;low calorie&#8221; &#8220;reduced fat&#8221; ect. lean people buy all the real productes this is not because they are lean and that they dont need to worry but the truth is that the low calorie versions of foods make you fatter through the processing.<br />
Number one thing if you want to loose wieght never and i say never reward yourself with food for a good week of dieting. The number one time people go back to there old eating habits is when somethings changes like a vacation or a different meal this is the very worst thing you can do. If you want to reward yourself go and buy a new pair of pants.<br />

<p>The only advantage I can see to a daily weigh is that if you record it, you can see a more accurate curve in your weight loss.  It worked for you, but focusing on losing tenths of a pound in a day is  impossible to measure accurately and potentially discouraging if there is a one or two pound fluctuation.  </p>
<p>It should be noted that if you plan to track your weight daily, you should do it at roughly the same point in your day  (ie right after you wake up or work out) so that your fluid levels will be close to the same.</p>

It&#8217;s a great, easy trick to losing weight. Thirst, when in low levels, is often confused with hunger, and so it makes us eat more! just drinking water subsides these urges.</p>

I realized that without drinking the water, I was feeling much more hungry.  I know alot of people struggle with the water issue, but it is so important.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to share a low fat breakfast suggestion.  I take a 60 cal, low fat yogurt to work and if I miss my cheerio/red fat milk breakfast, I just add the cheerios to my yogurt. </p>
<p>Also eating something crunchy such as low fat/low sugar cereal (cheerios)makes a good snack.</p>
<p>I measure out my food. </p>
<p>Also, I know of a free website that helps with tracking food and physical exercise.  Write me if you are interested.   </p>

<p>I, like you need daily encouragements to stay on track. After I reach my goal, I&#8217;ll weigh myself only a couple of times a week.  Weight gain happens while you&#8217;re not paying attention, so what gets measured should automatically improve if you make an effort.<br />
One comment on water intake. I heard that a lack of water actually triggers hunger impulses.</p>

Every body is different.  Also, gender does play another role in weight loss.  Men lose weight quicker than women.  Personally, I&#8217;m in peri-menopausal years, which is taking me much more longer to lose.  For a woman, to weigh in everyday is not a good idea.  Our weight constantly fluctuates up and down&#8230;because of our periods and such.  We tend to retain water; men don&#8217;t.  So, your advice might be great for young men, but it&#8217;s not good for women of any age.<br />
Again, congrats on your weight loss and I wish you continued success of keeping it off!</p>

I recently got motivation to actually work at losing weight. My friend is taking me and some other friends to an anime-con next August and my mom told me that if I lost 50 pounds or more in 10 months, she&#8217;d buy me that costume I want for it. That&#8217;s when I found this article. Your story made me believe that I could lose even more weight than I had originally been set to lose. With these tips, I&#8217;ll aim for losing 70 pounds in 10 months. Since I&#8217;m a girl, I&#8217;ll weigh more than usual at times and I know it&#8217;s a long shot, but, why not me?</p>

Secondly, you need to stop exercising quite so much. More than an hour of aerobic and you are actually eating away muscle. You need to make sure that you are doing resistance workouts in combination with your cycling.  Good luck.</p>

<p>I hope this next idea helps as well.  In my opinion, by working out closer to your noted bedtime (e.g. ride an exercise bike right before going to bed), the need to refuel, in order to get through the rest of the day&#8217;s tasks, should be easier to maintain since you only need to refuel for sleep.  Furthermore, by preventing properly allocated fuels from being leached too early, from an early/day workout, you may be able to avoid having to contend with the additional refueling being followed by less rigorous activity (i.e. desk work).  Also, you may prevent feeling less fueled, so early in the day and without a due work break; whereby, preventing any opting for less healthy food choices.  Thus, your healthier meal choices, through out the day, will already have worked in your benefit as they will have continued to fuel you for all your daily tasks either at work or at school.  </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />

weight loss at his level is very unhealthy&#8230;i too have weight problems..but the most affective way to loose weight is to eat 6 small meals a day and work out EVERY DAY&#8230;we all need to break out of this lazy shell and work out&#8230;trust me, it was hard to do..but after a while your body begins to get stronger and working out becomes less uncomfortable&#8230;.plus think of how healthy you are getting&#8230;.</p>
<p>always remember, you can loose visual weight and still be unhealthy and at risk for heart problems&#8230;only CARDIO will get you into the best shape of your life&#8230;.</p>
<p>i wish the best of luck for all of you&#8230;its a hadr thing to do&#8230;but it is possible&#8230;.</p>

I had two cups of coffee (cream, no sugar) and one slice toast (no toppings) for breakfast; I ate red pears for lunch (as many as I wanted); for dinner, I ate whatever was served at home, but I used a small salad plate and allowed myself one serving.  Turns out portion control is key to diets.  PS..The red pears are full of fiber.  If I was really starving, I&#8217;d drink a SlimFast, but that was only a few times a week.  I have kept this weight off for 10 years.</p>

<p>One note of caution: If you have diabetes or other medical conditions, you MUST consult with your medical team prior to implementing radical (or even slight) changes to your diet. When you have other factors come into play (sugar control issues, insulin dependency, etc.) then it is best to WORK WITH your doctor(s) or nurse(s) to let them help you with a specialized plan for your needs and situation. </p>
<p>Overall, great postings, but I wanted to remind those who are in &#8216;severe&#8217; case of obesity or who has special medical conditions to remember to consult the medical team first.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-285478" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi<br />
I think your diet tips are accurate. Congratulations for your achievement! You have made a gradual change.</p>
<p>I would like to add here, that I do disagree a bit with the everyday scale hopping, because as for me, weighing myself becomes a compulsive thing. First you weight yourself once a day, then three times etc so on. I also find myself wanting to go lower and lower.<br />
So it´s good to also set a LOWEST limit. As a woman, its easy to look for weight that is ideal from a fashion state of being, eg BMI under 18, so its good to set the lowest weight goal too as its hard to keep an underweight weight for too long. All of us have a certain weight range like you said 5-10 pound fluctuation between that range, so me at 5´8 ,171cm,seeking to be 122 pounds 56kg,, is too little for me, because maintaining this weight is very hard for me. My ideal weight is 132pounds or 60kg, easy to maintain and i can still eat normally, not in excess not on extreme diet.<br />
I also think having an eat what you want day once a week is a good thing, otherwise you will not get to enjoy life to the fullest and somepoint your cravations will take over.<br />
Remembering also that weight loss is done for mostly health reasons is an important factor and also being satisfied and content when you reach your goal, rather than always set it lower and lower.<br />
Thank you, im cutting 10pounds that i´ve gained after the summer. You gave me motivation!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-287785" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>A year and a half ago I had finally taken into consideration the fact that I was extremly overweight. I was 18 years old and 225 pounds. My sister in law came to visit for the summer ( i hadnt seen her for 5 months) and she was 40 pounds lighter than she was. I asked her how she did it and she told me that she used the Atkins diet. I looked up information, booked out books out the library, and bought the necessary foods to begin my diet. I had no problem going on the diet, I was ready for it. I started June of 2006, and my october of 2006 I was now weighing 159 pounds. I had lost 66 pounds and 32 inches total on my body. It works fast and I was extremly satisfied with the end result. I could eat whatever I wanted after i lost my weight for almost a year and I didnt gain anything! It was awesome. HOWEVER, this past Thanksgiving and Christmas I went all out on eating all the food because its the holidays, I wanted to celebrate. After the holidays it was hard to get back to eating the way I was before, and still to this day im having a hard time cutting back on the sugars and un-healthy foods. So, a few moments ago I stumbled across your website for some tips, and I think it will help me get back into my regular eating habbits. I will post on my updates in the comming days or weeks to let you know how everything is going. Thanks for the advice!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-288267" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Here is a tip that I use &#8230; I make salads &#8211;  vegetable and fruit &#8211; that can be eaten with a spoon.  Bottom line is that it takes longer to eat, fills you up and doesn&#8217;t leave room for the potatoes and gravy.  Vegetable salads can be any lettuce, greens, carrots, beets, tomatoes, celery, WHATEVER chopped really small&#8230;I usually add a teaspoon of sunflower seeds, peanuts, almonds, whatever&#8230; lean small bits of chopped chicken, lean beef, etc. can be added or small pieces of cheese.  I rarely use any dressing&#8230;Fruit salad the same way&#8230;I chop fresh fruit, apples, pineapple, bananas, I add a teaspoon of nuts, you can add dried fruit, raisins, prunes&#8230;The natural sugars make it sweet and tasty , cinammon can be added for a little flare. You can chop up a small fruit salad for dessert without feeling guilty.   If you omit fruits or veggies that get too juicy or turn brown you can put the salad in a baggie and take it with you for lunch. This is good for children, full of fiber &#8230; trick is that it must be chopped small enuf to eat with a spoon. The ingredients are unlimited, you can chop up whatever you like.  Summer really adds zing to the vegetable salad when the fresh produce starts coming in.   Peggy</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-288667" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hey man,</p>
<p>I love the tips you have here. Without coming across this website before I&#8217;ve actually used them over the past few months I&#8217;ve been dieting. I weighed 120 pounds the day before Thanksgiving, and this morning I weighed myself and I was 188 pounds. So, 30 pounds so far over the past 10 weeks. My overall goal is to get to 175-180. I totally agree with the weighing yourself everyday. If you only weigh yourself once a week, it&#8217;s hard to know whether or not you&#8217;re on the right track, especially when you&#8217;re not used to dieting or eating right. </p>
<p>One tip that I would give people starting down this adventure we call dieting is to put small amounts of things you enjoy in some of your meals. For instance, my big vice is cheese, and if I gave it up completely then I would have never been able to make it this far, and wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep going. So, I made spinach salads for myself most weekdays, but along with the skinless, bonesless chicken and other fruits I would put in a tablespoon of feta cheese. Not enough calories to make a huge difference, but just enough to be tastey and satisfy my cravings.</p>
<p>Good luck to anyone starting out! Be sure to follow the tip of making your diet public. You&#8217;ll be amazed how many compliments you get after just the first 10 pounds!</p>

I avoid plateaus by adding a workout and taking away a food group every few weeks.  Doing the same workout everyday for the duration of your diet will not stimulate your metabolism&#8211;it will actually cause your metabolism to adjust to what you are doing, and not burn as much as it would if you increase intensity over time.  Mix the intensity and duration of your workout routine to keep your metabolism guessing!  Good luck!</p>

Congrats on your weight loss. They are great tips, but I don’t believe they would fit everyone. Every body is different. Also, gender does play another role in weight loss. Men lose weight quicker than women. Personally, I’m in peri-menopausal years, which is taking me much more longer to lose. For a woman, to weigh in everyday is not a good idea. Our weight constantly fluctuates up and down…because of our periods and such. We tend to retain water; men don’t. So, your advice might be great for young men, but it’s not good for women of any age.<br />
Again, congrats on your weight loss and I wish you continued success of keeping it off!&#8221;</p>
<p>so TRUE, but I think a daily reminder of exactly where you are is essential&#8230; granted, you may be a pound or two heavier due to water weight gain, so you shouldn&#8217;t get completely downtrodden&#8230;</p>
<p>but that extra two pounds, is just MORE motivation to stay on track!!!!</p>
<p>These tips are FANTASTIC!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t give up, don&#8217;t make excuses&#8230;</p>
<p> just be real with yourself and the good or bad decisions you make, you know the difference!!</p>

<p>Chart your daily weight in excel. Make a line graph with moving averages. Just seeing your weight trending down is a huge motivator</p>

You want to make sure you stay away from gimmicks.  For men it may be possible because men have more muscle mass but you still have to be careful.</p>

<p>Dear colleague,</p>
<p>As you, I dieted to bring down my BMI from 32 to under 25 and now I&#8217;m statistically healthy. I&#8217;m amazed at the number of common techniques we both used. Contrary to all recommendations: buy a precision scale and weigh yourself every day. I can confirm this works by my own experience.<br />
Another three we share is the red flag weight limit, the 8 glasses of water and the exercise. By the way, I lost my 80 pounds overweight almost 20 years ago but it took me two years to get there. My BMI is still in the &#8220;healthy&#8221; brackett, I hope yours is too.</p>

I know for the fact I&#8217;m overweight and for sooo long I&#8217;ve wanted to get rid of it all. This summer is the summer before I go to my first year of high school. I don&#8217;t feel like going because of my weight is embarrassing. I always have my dad saying I need to lose it and it really hurts when he does. But this year after many years I&#8217;ve decided that I would always work to lose weight. My bones are big and I&#8217;m just built big but I shouldn&#8217;t be this heavy. I have a goal to lose 50 pounds in 3 months before school starts back up. But my only problem is I don&#8217;t want my parents thinking I&#8217;m pushing myself. I&#8217;m scared because I have a 75% chance of getting type 1 diabetes. I don&#8217;t want it and if I don&#8217;t lose weight I&#8217;ll only end up getting it. How do I convince the people around me ( family ) that I&#8217;m not pushing myself and that I really can lose the weight without them believing I&#8217;m pushing myself to far? This is something I really want without harming myself. It would be a grate help if you could tell me.<br />
Thanks alots,<br />
Amy M.</p>

And i am always picking on my self for my weight, and when I do it my friends always say I don&#8217;t and I know I do and I how do I tell them i do?like  if I said I was on a diet, they wont speak to me. But yet if they saw me outside running they will be fine with it. Another problem is I only have less than 66 days to complete this should I work as hard as my body lets me, or just take it easy? It would help me out a great deal if you could help me on this!<br />
Thanks,<br />

I made it automatic by using a treadmill desk. I walk all day at work at slow speeds, never sweating and after a few months I am a new person! You can make your own but you may run into problems with posture etc. I found the TrekDesk to be the best I have seen so far. You can read about it at <a href="http://www.trekdesk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.trekdesk.com</a>. Good luck to you and keep up the hard work, maybe make it a little easier with a treadmill desk.</p>

<p>Actually, the whole &#8216;don&#8217;t eat after 7pm&#8217; thing is mostly a bit of a falsehood. Your body needs a certain number of calories every day. If I have 200 cals left at 8pm, I&#8217;m totally able to eat those 200 cals and go right to bed without worry. The clincher: make the calories count. eating a 200 cal piece of cake (that would be a small piece) is not as good as a 200 cal glass of milk or some fruit. As long as you&#8217;re not going over your maximum calorie count for the day and that bedtime snack isn&#8217;t a medium pizza, then you&#8217;ll be OK.</p>

<p>1) Digital scale… yep.<br />
2) Weigh daily… I did it but didn&#8217;t start actually <a href="http://joeaveragegetsfit.com/2008/06/08/you-cant-fool-mother-nature/" rel="nofollow">recording my weight</a> until I discovered the benefits.<br />
3) Water… check<br />
4) Make diet public… I&#8217;ve been blogging at joeaveragegetsfit.com to keep myself accountable.<br />
5) I don&#8217;t do this.<br />
6) Yeah, biggie.<br />
… etc. </p>
<p>The biggest factor, however, is that how one cares for (or abuses) their body is primarily a mental game. Get the subconscious aligned with your goal and the self-defeating behaviour starts to disappear. </p>
<p>If an average Joe like me can do it, anybody can.</p>

You&#8217;re tips are very helpful and I look forward to applying them. But another small tip of advice, it is best to weigh yourself in the morning before you eat anything. You can weigh yourself at night and then in the morning and there can be up to a 2 pound difference! So its best to weigh yourself in the  morning.<br />
and again, thank for the awesome tips :)</p>

<p>There are many factors that determine the success or failure of your weight loss goals. In this article I will tell you about some of the things you should do in order to lose weight successfully.</p>
<p>1. Set small goals: Most people are unable to achieve their weight loss goals because they always think big. There is nothing wrong with thinking big, but don&#8217;t make your goals so big as though they become overwhelming and intimidating to you! Don&#8217;t stretch your weight loss goals so far that you feel tempted to quit your weight loss program altogether! Start slow and you will see how easy it is to shed those obstinate pounds!</p>
<p>You know that you need to make huge lifestyle in order to lose weight successfully. Now, keep in mind that you cannot make these changes overnight! For example, if today I ask you to avoid eating junk foods altogether, will you be able to follow my advice? You will probably try hard to avoid junk foods for a day or two, and by doing that, you will be all the more tempted to take a bite of your favorite fatty foods. As a result, you&#8217;ll end up gaining more pounds than what you started with! What a waste!</p>
<p>Here is an easier way to do it: instead of trying to cut down on your junk food intake entirely, try to replace one junk food with one good food. Do you eat butter? Well, replace that with peanut butter. Next day, replace burgers with raw carrots! If you eat white breads, replace that with wholegrain wheat breads.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t be able to accomplish all of these changes overnight, but you will be able to archive your goals if you do it slowly, bit by bit. Eventually you will realize that you have completely replaced your bad foods with the healthy foods, but without going through any stress or temptation!</p>
<p>2. Replace bad habits with the good ones: Remember that you gained weight because of certain bad habits. Ideally you should break those old habits in order to lose weight, but I know that breaking an old habit is easier said than done. What you can do instead of modify your bad habit enough so that it becomes a good and healthy habit. </p>
<p>If you are like most people, you have a habit of snacking in the afternoon. Instead of trying to break your afternoon snacking habit, try to replace the snack itself!. If you eat chocolate soups and cookies as snacks, replace them with low-fat yogurt and raw fruits!</p>
<p>3. Get rid of temptations: Unless you learn to control your temptations, you won&#8217;t be able to lose weight successfully. One overwhelming temptation most people suffer from is that of food. Whenever you are tempted to eat, do something that would distract you from the thought of food. You can do anything such as dancing, driving, walking around your house, doing some sit-ups, or drinking a glass of water. All of these things will help keep yourself away from the continuous food cravings!</p>

<p>The key to daily weigh-ins is to AVERAGE your weight over a period of time (I use a 7 day moving average).  I use a modified version of the Hacker&#8217;s Diet spreadsheet to do this, but the math itself is simple enough to do on paper if you prefer.</p>
<p>The daily average is what you want to set your eye on when figuring out how you&#8217;re doing on your chosen diet.  If the trend is moving downward, you are doing fine.  If it starts bobbing upward, you need to make adjustments.</p>
<p>Motivationally, there is a very, very big difference between using the moving average and using the daily figure!</p>

Anyway, I try to maintain a 1,000 calorie daily deficit, and I use the exercise regiment from The Hacker&#8217;s Diet.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-331609" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I posted a couple of weeks ago, and wanted to check back in. So far I am down 32 pounds in 42 days.  At this point already I feel like I have complete control of my weight.  I know before I get on the scale about how much I have lost since my last reading.  While my body weight fluctuates throughout the day (as does everyone&#8217;s) my first reading in the morning is always lower than the day before.  I&#8217;ve had several &#8216;days off&#8217; where I ate whatever I wanted to and seemed to lose even MORE after those days.  I think there is something to the notion of calorie-shifting.  In any case, I&#8217;m convinced that basic math will work for *everyone*:  Drink LOTS of water every day, at least the two liters that Kyle recommends.  I try and drink between three and four.  The constant peeing is annoying, but you learn to plan around commutes and such.  Stick to less than 1,000 calories every day until you get a feel for how much you need to eat to maintain your energy levels and still lose weight.  I typically eat about 150 for breakfast, 300-400 for lunch and another 500-600 for dinner.  I eat at least one salad every single day.  A good rule for dinners for me has been to have a big salad plus a small portion of whatever my family is eating.  I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m missing out on anything but a big gut. I only exercise for 15 minutes each day, per the Hackers Diet, but coupled with everything else that I&#8217;m doing, I&#8217;m averaging almost a pound a day.  I&#8217;ll give another report in a few weeks if anyone is interested.</p>

I have lost 19 lbs so far, and have nothing to complain about&#8230;but some of the things you noted really made sense so I thought I would give them a try.  Weighing myself daily would be a diet disaster for me, but that is just my tick.  Weekly weigh-ins work fine for me.  I really like your red-flag rule.  That is just the sort of thing that will work for me.  Thanks for sharing your success and the techniques you used to reach your weight goal.</p>

Salt retains water so will add weight and takes time to evacuate the system.  Adding apple cider/vinegar supplements help to rid the body of excess water weight.  Also, eat only wholewheat, multi-grain or ancient grain breads and buns rather than white bread so you are adding fiber to your diet.  Ground flax seed is an excellent addition to smoothies and yoghurt and helps to rid the body of cholest. and scrubs your insides free of excess waste.</p>

First of all, your whole idea of how little of your life you will spend dieting is crazy, because if you consider it a temporary diet, you will start going back up to your original weight right after you finish! You have to consider it a lifestyle change, which will be with you for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>Second of all, if you don&#8217;t diet on the weekends, it cuts out one of the most important parts of weightloss, which is a change in your metabolism. That would also stunt your diet horribly because part of weightloss is rehabilitation from addiction to unhealthy foods, and if every weekend you are loading up again, you will never get past those addictions!</p>
<p>Also, drinking water so that you don&#8217;t feel hungry is only effective if you are eating frequent small meals and are having trouble getting by that way, which is unlikely. If you are using that trick to go long periods without eating, than you are going to slow your metabolism down to a crawl, because your body will go into a starvation mode and start clinging to every single little calorie.</p>
<p>Whatever you were doing may have worked for you, but these diet tips as a whole would be very ineffective for most people.</p>

After trying numerous diets without success, I began drinking a fruit juice, a high protein drink and eating natural fibre (in yogurt) and the results are incredible.<br />
I don&#8217;t think eating less is the solution as your body needs fuel to function and if you deprive it of that fuel and you can not concentrate on your job. You need protein to save your muscles in a diet.</p>

I discovered many of these myself and they work!! One exception is the &#8220;take weekends off&#8221;. I could do that when I was younger but I can&#8217;t get away with it now in my mid-40s. Metabolism slows as one ages and, while I can eat what I want if I am EXTREMELY careful with portion control, I can&#8217;t let go on the weekends. I also take issue with you on the diet colas. Lots of research is coming out about the negatives of artificial sweeteners and one of them is that the sweetness makes cravings worse, therefore making it harder to stick to a sensible eating plan. If it works for you, great, but if you are having problems and can&#8217;t figure out why then ditch the artificial junk and go for natural foods. The real stuff is better for you anyway. :)</p>

But sincerely, I am not the fan of diets because simple reason &#8211; if you are overweight due to eating too much you can loose weight, but you will bulk up back, if you continue to eat as you used, after diet ending. I think that only solution is to have non-stop balanced nutrition intake.</p>

I&#8217;ve been basically following the same rules since May and by August I&#8217;m down 45 pounds.  The weekend tip has been a lifesaver for me. I call Monday my &#8220;recovery&#8221; day.  That&#8217;s the day I am the most strict to get back on track from the weekend.  I feel that getting into this habit will also help me keep the weight off when the time comes.  </p>
<p>I still try to eat healthy on the weekends but when there&#8217;s weddings, birthday parties, cookouts or other fun things planned, I want to take part in the festivities.  So far I&#8217;ve managed to eat, drink and be merry and still lose weight.  It can be done!</p>

Swimming laps works every muscle in your body and is ideal for anyone! If you swim freestyle for an hour you can burn 900 calories. Swimming is low impact and is a great alternative to the gym. especially or people who have not exercised in a long time, people with injuries, and people who want to burn calories=lose weight.</p>

<p>The way I make myself walk is, I have my breakfast, then I have to walk to Morrisons to buy lunch and tea, that&#8217;s 2.3 miles away. Then I walk home again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sticking to 1200 calories per day. It wasn&#8217;t easy at first, but now I&#8217;m doing it no problems.</p>
<p>Breakfast: Nutri Grain Bar &amp; Glass Of Orange<br />
Lunch: 1KG Tub Fruit &amp; Water<br />
Tea: Granola Yoghurt &amp; Water</p>
<p>That keeps me not hungry all day.</p>
<p>Doing this, I have lost 52lb (23.4KG) since April.</p>
<p>Still got 40lb to go before Xmas. (I&#8217;m going skydibing in California, and need to be 250lbs or less)</p>

I recommend eating off a salad plate (when available). It fits a lot less food on the plate. When you are finished eating, take a 3-4 minute break to decide if you are still hungry and need more or if you are completley finished. This little trick helps with the &#8220;eyes-are-bigger-than-stomach&#8221; syndrome.</p>

<p>Here is the truth about weight loss&#8230;.</p>
<p>3500 calories = 1 pound</p>
<p>Figure out the amount of calories your body naturally burns (BMR) and times it by your activity rating (1.2 if you are sedentary). Also, add the amount of calories you burn in exercise.</p>
<p>If you eat less than that calculated amount of calories, you will lose weight. </p>
<p>If you cut 3500 calories over the period of a few days, you will lose 1 pound.</p>
<p>Also, it is exceedingly unhealthy to eat less than 1000 calories a day. Your body will go into starvation mode and it will slow down your weightloss.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be one of those stuck up people who thinks they know everything, but I&#8217;m a calorie counter and have seen 25 pounds of successful loss based on this principal.</p>
<p>Once again, great suggestions!!!</p>

If your weight has dropped so much that your ribs are sticking through your skin and you maintain an extremely low calorie diet, then, and only then, will your body start to shut down your metabolic rate by 40% or more and enter &#8216;starvation mode&#8217;. At that point you will feel extremely ill and will probably be unable to walk or even get out of bed. I think we can safely assume that no-one reading this will ever experience &#8216;starvation mode&#8217;!</p>

I have had success using WW points plan and a supplement I found on a website <a href="http://www.embassyshopper.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.embassyshopper.com</a> the supplement is called slimmetry and uses green tea extracts and cuts your appetite. So in addition to the water intake this helped me lose 50lbs over 8months&#8230; and I am 57 yrs old so my metabolism is a little slower than alot of the folks posting here. Good luck everyone keep up the effort, you will be happy with the results.</p>

I found your site looking for ways to lose weight healthy but fast.  I&#8217;ve been diagnosed with a fatty liver at age 26 and have been given 6 months to lose at least 40 lbs or my liver will start failing and I will be dead in a year.  The odds of getting a liver transplant are very small, so I know that if I don&#8217;t do something, I will be dead.  My current weight is at 230. I have a 2 year old daughter who needs me so I&#8217;m doing everything possible to get fit.  My sister has graciously brought over her elliptical machine so that I can work out at home.  My daughter&#8217;s dad travels for work, so I&#8217;m doing the &#8220;single mom&#8221; role. I used to be a McDonald&#8217;s and Burger King person as it was fast and easy. I&#8217;ve started to eat Turkey burgers, salads, drink more water, etc&#8230;  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read through all your document and have taken it all to heart.  I just want to thank you for advertising this and giving great information. I hope too that I can write again in 6 months and let you know I&#8217;ve reached my goal.  Best wishes.</p>

I just started to follow the weight watchers plan and I noticed that I feel fuller with this plan longer than any other diet plan I have ever tried. I am doing everything you did. What kind of workout did you do? I walk/jog for 30 minutes and take about 10 minutes for hand weights and 5 minutes to stretch. I hope that I am as successful as you have been!</p>

That&#8217;s 8 sizes for me!  I have to agree with the guy that said drinking diet sodas is like smoking &#8220;light&#8221; cigarettes.  Don&#8217;t do it!  The week I gave up diet sodas, I lost 5 lbs!  I haven&#8217;t had one since.  I do agree that it is encourging to weigh every day.  It&#8217;s nice to see that 5 or 8 oz loss.  The biggest tip of advice is don&#8217;t give up!  Even if you fall of the wagon for a couple of days, or weeks&#8230;.get back on!  The change I feel and see is so worth it.  It&#8217;s the greatest reward!</p>

Then went to work overseas and forgot everything, amazing how the brain can con us into thinking we &#8220;don&#8217;t have the time&#8221; anyway I put all the weight back on. I&#8217;m currently back on the eliptical machine, and have lost 22 pounds again, but will keep a better focus this time, and have a red flag weight. Thanks.</p>

I didn&#8217;t go on any specific diet or anything I just did things I knew I&#8217;d have to do to maintain a diet because maintaining a diet is the hardest part. I do the weekend thing too and that is the most important. It gives me something to look forward to and gives me motivation for the next week. I haven&#8217;t tried the water yet but I will now! Great tips. Worked great for me!!</p>

I especially like the idea of weighing yourself every day &#8211; brilliant. Drinking loads of water is important in more ways than you think. A lot of acid is created when you burn off fat, and water helps to flush it out of your system.</p>

I have had a problem with weight for some time now it goes up and down a lot. Right now I am at my heaviest and it totally sucks and your article kinda brought me to tears because I have been trying to start a diet for a while now but something is holding me back, but you saying that you lost all that weight by only dieting 5 days made me so happy but I was wondering how the two other days went, did you eat whatever you wanted and on those days did you still weigh yourself because wouldnt your weight go up some after not being on the diet? and did you work out everyday or just a few days a week?<br />
Thank you again, I think that reading your article just might help me finally start a diet and actually stay on it!</p>

I went from a size 12 to a size 4 in about 6 months. Your absolutely right about not dieting on the weekends. It helped with my motivation during the week. And I was still able to indulge in the finer delicacies over the weekend. That way I didn&#8217;t feel like it was plain torture to diet and exercise why everyone else got to eat ice cream.<br />
Anyway two years later I had a baby and man has it changed everything. lol<br />
I was diagnosed with post pardum and dealing with a lot of family drama, I ended up weighing close to 200 pounds after my son was born. So right now after reading your article it has motivated me. I remember how energized I felt after a work out. Its getting past the first two weeks in order to really enjoy it. Thank you again and congrats to you.</p>

You did a great job.Actually If I were you i would be so proud of myself.<br />
Well im a 17 year old teenaged girl, when I was 14, I used to be 62 kg,but I had this friend who encouraged me and helped me to lose 8 kgs in a 3 months time..afterwards I went through some rough days and i had to get over the stress by eating, I used to eat even when Im not  hungry..I became an emotional eater and now Im a Binge eater, I can&#8217;t stop eating by a way or another, I tried every single thing,but nothing worked, Im so frustrated.<br />
now im 70 kgs with a height of 168 cms.<br />
I hope i can go on this diet and shed some pounds..</p>

Psychologists say you must found a healthy replacement, when your trying to eliminate a negative habit like over eating. My healthy replacement was to eat as much as I wanted as long as it was low calorie, fat, cholesterol and sodium. The weight just fell off. Here are the specifics on the diet and meal plans <a href="http://bit.ly/b3vN0d" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/b3vN0d</a> </p>
<p>I hope this helps you avoid the fad diets and expensive supplements</p>

My only question is, did you seriously take a break on the weekend and still lose weight? I can have a great week and slip up at one meal &#8211; just one &#8211; and not even go crazy, maybe get a burger instead of grilled chicken, and I will not not lose weight that week. At best I will remain the same. How exactly did you accomplish 50lbs in 3 months?<br />
I am a female but I&#39;m only 23. And again &#8211; I&#39;ve never pigged out, it&#39;s just a slip. So can you elorabate on what you did during your break or do you think it&#39;s just a difference between male and female dieting?<br />
I&#39;m very curious because, if I can take even a one day break a week, even if it takes me a year longer to lose the weight, 1) at least I can keep it off and 2) I won&#39;t drive myself crazy in the process.</p>

And its not like you were extremely obese and losing 50lbs was nothings.  50lbs was probably 25% of you.And you dieted for 60 days (no weekends), you need to have a deficit of 3500 cal/lb fat. That means you cut 2900 calories per day which is BS.</p>

You&#8217;ll typically notice that when you are starting a new &#8220;weight loss plan&#8221; you retain water from poor eating, and in a previous comment, a person mentioned you can hold 7 lbs or even more in your bowel. So cut out sodium, get more fiber and poodle you&#8217;ll release a lot of excess waste.</p>
<p>Here is another thing to keep in mind. When you start to work out regularly, your body builds muscle, and when you have more muscle you burn body fat at a very quick rate. So let&#8217;s re-examine the scientific facts here, you cut your calories, fat, salt starches/complex carbon: like white bread for example, and burn 2000 calories a day 5 days a week, you will most certainly lose in this time frame.</p>
<p>Do a sauna and steam room for extra boosts to losing calories, as well as swim, and let&#8217;s not forget when you DO drink a lot of water, it aides the digestive system in flushing additional fat from you body before its stored as a spare tire.</p>

However, I don&#8217;t go to great lengths to indulge, I follow pretty much the same eating pattern, just do it by ear instead of using my calorie-counting website.  So, I&#8217;m taking a break, but not completely.  </p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t weigh myself daily because I have one of those old-fashioned scales with the slide weights, and it&#8217;s finicky.  I weigh once a week so it feels like that pound magically disappeared when I wasn&#8217;t looking.  Seriously.  I&#8217;ve gotten used to my new eating habits so I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m working at it any more.  I&#8217;ve lost a pound a week consistently for the past 10 weeks.</p>

I have fibromyalgia which makes it hard to workout and lose weight without causing a flare up. My son is almost a year old, and in the past year I&#8217;ve tried different workout programs and diets, and they would work at first, I&#8217;d lose some weight, but then I&#8217;d have a flare up and be unable to workout for over a week, and then I&#8217;d gain weight again.<br />
I found a workout and diet plan that works best for me and so far I&#8217;ve been having GREAT success! I&#8217;ve been feeling better than ever and so far I&#8217;ve been able to keep the weight off. Almost a year after my son was born and I&#8217;m FINALLY able to lose the baby weight and keep it off!<br />
I know it can be discouraging when you want to lose weight and can&#8217;t. You want to feel sexy, be the way you were before you had a baby. </p>
<p>I had talked to my doctor to see what he recommended for my situation, and it&#8217;s been working. I recommend talking to your doctor as well and see what they say for you. </p>
<p>Good luck, don&#8217;t give up!</p>

If you are active you probably burn closer to 3000. if you eat 1000 calories per day, you have a calorie deficit of about 2000 per day which would be about 14,000 per week. 14,000 divided by 3500 is 4 lbs per week. If you work out more closer to 5 lbs per week. 20 lbs a month x 2 is 40 lbs. It can be done because weight loss is a science, not a matter of opinion, it&#8217;s all in the numbers.</p>

So Ginger is not full of crap. that&#8217;s why nutritional facts have the &#8216;based on a 2000 calorie a day diet&#8217;. Moron.  With exercise and activity I can easily burn 3000 calories a day. Most people who aren&#8217;t as overweight as I am can burn 2500 pretty easily. The hard part is sticking to the 1500 calories per day, or whatever you choose.  a 1000 calorie daily deficit will cause substantial weight loss. Just stick with it.<br />

<p>People who get the lap band will lose a lot of weight quickly, but I doubt they&#8217;ll be eating less than 1200Kcal a day, therefore, will be losing weight perfectly healthily. (They use the 1-2lbs a week as a guideline, as in normal circumstances, that would equate to a daily intake of 1200Kcal &#8211; 1600Kcal a week.)</p>

I am 5&#8217;2 and I recently met my goal weight of 115. I am reccomended only 1,600 calories per day. The more you weigh, the more you burn. You may be losing that way now, but once you get down to your goal weight calories per day change. If I were to eat 2000 calories per day I would be gaining significantly. IRt may sound impossible, but the less fat you have to feed, the less you will want to eat. I had a party last week where I ate 2,300 calories and I was almost sick to my stomach. Reccommended amounts will change with your own personal weight and height. I reccommend to anyone that they find out what they need (try mypyramid.gov) and stick to your own personal calorie plan, rather than follow a general one. I was told that the minimum amount of calories anyone should consume in one day is 1,200- which is not reccommended daily.</p>

I also agree with your comment, the only way you can continue to lose weight without increasing exercise or reducing calories is to attach weights to your body that keep you at your previous weight.</p>

When people say you will start storing fat if you go under 1200 calories, they aren&#8217;t very knowledgeable.  As long as you are feeding your body a healthy, well balanced diet you can do as low as 900 calories and still lose weight.  Of course you can go lower and lose weight but then you will start losing muscle and your organs will suffer.  The only way you will start storing fat on a low calorie diet is if you start gorging on food all of a sudden, thenyou will start gaining weight of course.  The role of thumb is healthy low calories and exercise&#8230;.actually very simple, sometimes easier said then done though.</p>

Roughly&#8230; Its actually more like between 1800 and 2400. Basically that means eating breakfast lunch and dinner and all the other meals in between. If you remain within your Cal range then you will not lose any more or gain anymore weight due the process of lipolysis or otherwise. It is in the numbers. the one think i hate though is that people use Cals and lbs&#8230; Why cant it all just be metric?! 6000Kjs dammit!</p>

He&#8217;s pointing out that the study showed that increased consumption of milk correlated to an increase in breast/moob size. That means drinking milk makes them bigger. He isn&#8217;t saying that all people with large breasts/moobs got that way BECAUSE of milk (this could be due to other factors like genetics) but that milk could potentially increase them. That means you could theoretically wind up with 34 F&#8217;s if you drank too much milk. HTH. :)</p>

The only thing you need to do is to create a calorie deficit. Every time the calories you burn are more than the calories you eat, you will lose weight. The source of calories is not important for weight loss (but it’s important for our health). Congratulations on your weight loss!</p>

( slow metabolism). I thought not dieting the weekends was a mistake but it works. Dieting sure is mentally exhausting. But I gained some of the weight back and found out when a read this that I failed at the red flag step. Working out helps a lot. Running got me so thirsty that I was full with water most of the day and the diet juice &#8220;on the go&#8221; packets did help a lot when choosing a drink. Also measuring the portions is important. I ate of everything but in little portions. Is hard to eat less at the begining but with time I felt  satisfied with a surprisingly small portion and it feels great. Daily vitamin supplements helps too.</p>

I would make 1 tweek and that is replace diet soda with green tea.  Green tea helps to burn fat.  Diet soda has fake sugar that is an excitotoxin that kills brain cells and disrupts your hormone levels.</p>

The downside is that the drastic effect crept up on me after listening to it every night during my bedside reading hours. At first, I found that it made keeping to my diet easier, then I found that I was actually having to make myself eat food and, eventually, I found that I was feeling actual revulsion at the mere thought of foods that I had normally enjoyed.<br />
When I realised what was happebibg, gradually, I was able to start  eating really nutritious food again.</p>

I am very much insecure with all of these skinny girls on television! It just makes my insecurity even worse! Not to mention my fiancé doesn&#8217;t help at all! When we have an argument he always brings up my weight, so of course what does a person with a weight prob do? Eat more! So without a good support system it&#8217;s even harder for me!!! But I have hope that I will be at a healthy weight again!!!! I just keep visualizing myself looking hot again one day! ;)</p>

That&#8217;s its purpose. Small cow -&gt; big cow. If we humans drink that species&#8217; lactate doesn&#8217;t it make you wonder if the same thing might happen? (Big humans, not big cows!)</p>
<p>Calcium absorption is actually reduced by other lactate ingredients. You&#8217;ll get much better calcium absorption rates from plants &#8211; Google and you will see :)</p>
<p>Also, there&#8217;s some evidence that milk drinking from early life reduces the ability of human bone cells to reproduce as we get older. High milk consumption may lead to osteoporosis in later life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend you cut the dairy for more than just the weight implications.</p>

I am really glad I found someone put there who is real and did a real diet and stuck with it. I googled how to lose 50lbs in 3 months and your post came up. I read it thinking to myself where is the catch and how much money did this guy really spend? I am alot like you, I am a 27y/o (female tho) looking to lose 50lbs, but I don&#8217;t like cutting things out, or missing social events with friends because of a diet. I hear the same thing all the time about you dont need to be on a diet, and other comments along that line. It is obvious i need to lose weight tho. I copied your post and emailed it    to myself:) I am praying this works for me as well as it did you. Everything you said made sense, so fingers crossed!! Thank you!!-Michelle</p>

<p>From the reading I&#8217;ve been doing lately your idea of going off the diet and having a couple of weekend days of not dieting will work better than being restrictive all the time. Apparently the reason why is that your body doesn&#8217;t go into starvation mode and try to hold on to as many calories as it can to sustain you through what it physiologically perceives as a threat. If you have a break from restricting your diet you can actually lose more weight and you don&#8217;t get as fed up. It&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll have better results over time.</p>

Sometimes the calories are ok but stuff like pasta for me &#8211; even in a small amount can affect my weight loss. I think if you&#8217;re ok with once a week great but I need to weigh myself daily for the motivation and information. </p>

I lost 30 pounds by doing Zumba (which is so much fun I&#8217;m dying to go to the gym all the time) and by being more conscious of what I ate. I&#8217;m very goal oriented as well and it didn&#8217;t make sense to people why I weighed myself so often and needed to see results all the time. It worked for me. I&#8217;ve kept the weight off for nearly 6 months now. I&#8217;ve found that what has been drilled into my head all my life, you know, making it a LIFESTYLE rather than just a diet, is the way to go. If you make it a real part of your life, not just a stint, you&#8217;ll stick with it more. It&#8217;s not a few weeks or even months thing, it&#8217;s a whole new life. </p>

I left a small notebook on my bathroom counter and recorded my weight everyday. <br />
I put sticky notes around my house reminding me to not go anywhere without my water bottle, to be happy because your mood is significant to being healthy, and to eat more small meals than fewer big meals. I would take my dog out jogging or if I wanted to exercise inside I would do lunges, squats, sit-ups, and push-ups. I still exercise sometimes, but i have found that if I do not eat when I am not hungry and if I watch how many calories I am consuming I have little need to exercise everyday still. I exercise at least 3 times a week. </p>

<p>While you may weight a pound more one day than the previous day because of an event, or even weigh a pound more on Sunday than you did LAST Sunday because of the pizza and beer you had Saturday night, when you average your 7 daily weights, you&#8217;ll always see a true decline, and keep your spirits up.</p>

Weight Watchers is a way to tabulate and record all foods eaten that have certain calorie &amp; fiber content within a DAILY total which vary according to your weight. They provide a digest of these different attributes per food item and even RESTAURANT ITEMS. The LATEST VERSION is that they give you a calculator that will keep these daily items and tell you what more POINTS you have for the entire day!</p>
<p>Example: I weigh 175 lbs.&#8211; It is advised that I have no more that 22-25 POINTS per day. ( 1 point is about 50 calories, but can decrease if the FIBER is high enough) If I consume ONLY those amounts, I can lose about 1 -1/2 lbs per week, safely. More if also including exercise.</p>
<p>If you join Weight Watchers, they will profile your points intake according to your present weight and GOAL. You will lose weight, but be on guard that it is something that needs support.  </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-367608" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hello! I have lost 22 pounds in 2 1/2 months, with 41 pounds to go. I cut red meat, pork, most dairy except nonfat yogurt, and bread, except some of my favorite club crackers. I am allowed certain &#8220;cheats&#8221;, like a few favorite crackers, frozen fat-free yogurt, and an occasional &#8220;real&#8221; soda. I also relax my diet on the weekends. If I have to cheat on my diet day, I will allow myself up to three bites of whatever it is I am wanting, like ice cream. If I do this, I also make sure to walk extra. A big, big thing for me was to get in the mind-set that each day was &#8220;start over&#8221; day&#8230;in other words, whether I &#8220;mess up&#8221; the day before or not,I do not allow myself to feel guilty anymore. I wake up the next day and tell myself this is Day 1, only it&#8217;s not starting all over because my beginning weight is lower and lower! It may sound silly,but it REALLY helps me to think that way. I also made some permanent food changes, adding lots of fresh fruit, lots of water (I used to hate water), and I have really learned to love salads. I have literally filled my refrigerator drawer with tons of sweet, delicious fruit that tastes so great after a long, hot walk!</p>

well today i just cheated! i had maybe 1 cup of ice cream and 2 thin mints. i am worried about by eating this i am going to gain weight. is that possible? i know a pound equals 3500 calories. i ate no where close to that but worried that i still will gain some pounds. </p>
<p>hope someone can help! thanks</p>

I have been doing I diet similar to yours on and off for a few months not. Unexpected things keep popping up in life causing me to put my diet on hold. But this time I have made some tweaks to where I have no excuse. I switched to Crystal Light instead of soda&#8230;it allows me to get an sufficient amount of water and because juice has so much sugar and a whole lot of points, starting drinking my coffee black, and have added slim fast drinks as meal substitutes when I am able too. Been doing this for a week now, no weight loss yet, but its bound to happen. Thank you for posting this and validating my personalized diet.<br />

Don&#8217;t eat after 7 latest but if u must try having a granola bar ( special k fruit crisps are realy good and healthy ps nutrigrain is not a healthy granola bar btw) and remember to read the labels to find the healthiest choise but dint buy things you can&#8217;t stomach.

The only thing you need to do is to create a calorie deficit. Every time the calories you burn are more than the calories you eat, you will lose weight. The source of calories is not important for weight loss (but it’s important for our health). Congratulations on your weight loss!</p>

<p>Right now I am determined not to return to my old habits and make this a permanent change.  I also agree with the various comments pointing out that weight loss is all about science.  Burn more calories than you consume and you will lose weight :)</p>

I just really wanted to let you know that diet soda can be very dangerous for you, because it contains aspartame, which at body tempurature turns into formaldehyde. Which is the chemical they use to preserve the dead. It can cause cancer in the long run.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-369471" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Sorry Julia, this is widely believed, but it is pure, 100% pseudoscience. I have my PhD in cell biology and have done research at Harvard Medical School. Aspartame is broken down into amino acids and methanol. Some think the methanol will later be metabolized to formaldehyde. If you look at methanol released, diet soda has half the amount of methanol as the same amount of fruit juice. Plus, there is less phenylalanine (the amino acid) in diet soda than an egg, a glass of milk, and a hamburger. As a matter of fact, a glass of milk has about 5x the amino acid and a hamburger 9X! No change in methanol or phenylalanine was observed even when an adult was given the equivalent of 15 cans of diet soda a day.</p>
<p>Now I have no ties to aspartame, but I get frustrated by scientific  myths. This is especially frustrating because a lo of diabetic patients, who would greatly benefit from substituting sugar with asp., are scared to use aspartame because of pseudoscience repeated over and over by people who don&#8217;t really no the facts.</p>
<p>Finally, for anyone who doesn&#8217;t believe a random guy on the internet (and I don&#8217;t blame you), there is a good article/short communication in &#8216;The Lancet&#8217; (one of the top medical journals). It&#8217;s written in layman terms and goes into a little more detail than I what I have put here. It was published July of 1999 by Zehetner and Mclean, both endocrinologist. </p>

Her story might not sound as stunning as this article, but the thing is that while she&#8217;s losing weight, she looks and is actually getting more healthy than before. She followed &#8220;The Diet Solution Program&#8221;, and it is really magic. Myself is now on the program as well. I just started it a week ago and haven&#8217;t seen significant result yet. But I think it&#8217;s a matter of time and I will definitely stay positive because her story is just a miracle to me. Here is the link if anybody wants to try. </p>

I am currently starting a diet plan I ended up making myself because I tried so many others online. It is similar to yours but I&#8217;m more or less making sure I exercise and keeping calories (at all costs) below 1200 calories a day. I am glad I read your comment on diet drinks! I can now drink a coke zero and not feel bad!! I too had my mother and friends saying &#8216;be careful the stuff in that can will kill you&#8217;. Sigh. Anyway I am also going to be doing more and more exercise as the diet progresses. I am doing great so far but I&#8217;m sure that will plateau. Thanks for the great article and for showing that will a little self control it can be done. Oh and I also weigh myself in the morning with no clothes and an empty bladder to get a much better idea of my true weight and you&#8217;re absolutely right. Seeing that you&#8217;ve even lost 100-200g in a day is actually seriously motivating. Congrats and keep up the good work! </p>

<p>The cardio each day helps me to sweat off the bad stuff, and it activates the metabolism the most of anything else. The muscle workouts keeps a solid base of muscle going which boosts the metabolism since muscle takes more calories to maintain than fat. The water intake it important because all cellular functions require water as fuel or as a catalyst. Eating throughout the day helps your body prevent starvation mode, and you&#8217;ll feel better and not panic about being on a diet. The cheat day makes it so that your body can&#8217;t reach homeostasis at 1500 calories/2000 calories for too long, so it will continue burning fat. The crunches and pushups is a muscle builder and final metabolic push for the day right before sleeping, and you&#8217;ll sleep more soundly at night as well. By limiting carbohydrates it puts your body into ketosis, which forces it to grab onto and shrink the fat cells at a quicker pace. Potatoes are full of starches and other things which will make it difficult to burn fat for your body as it will become more reluctant to do so. The high protein intake is a muscle builder if you like that sort of thing, but it&#8217;s also a protector. This is to counteract the lower intake of carbohydrates because as your body seeks to find other fuels it will grab onto muscle mass, and by flooding your muscles with proteins, it will grab and disseminate those proteins instead of muscle tissue.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a biology major at one of &#8220;those&#8221; institutions and after going through my courses, and trying and failing other diets, I used what I knew about the chemistry of the human body to create a plan that I&#8217;m positive can work for anyone. The only issue is that in the first 6 weeks, you will NOT want to do any of this. But now I can&#8217;t imagine not doing all of this everyday.<br />
I hope someone can benefit from this.</p>

At the moment, I&#8217;m trying to be a vegetarian, but without the tasty meat to satisy my tastebuds, I&#8217;ve found a new love in all food and I now eat pretty much anything vegetarian that I never used to&#8230; this is a real problem, because I just LOVE tasty food! AND EVERYTHINGS SO MUCH MORE TASTY WITHOUT MEAT! So if you&#8217;re like me, I recommend meat to control yourself..<br />
(not scientifically proven, just life experience and particular circumstances I live in) Good luck!<br />
PS (to any vegetarian haters, I&#8217;m trying to go back but it&#8217;ll take time because it&#8217;s scary changing, I feel meat will hurt somehow. Don&#8217;t hate, I&#8217;m getting over it. x)</p>

your body is the only way to do always yoga it will help a lot to loose weight<br />
and use to have a juice and fruits in breakfast. Try to follow this in a daily<br />
routine it is going to help a lot in loosing weight. So I will suggest doing<br />
training and exercises daily. This will help you to maintain a good health and<br />
body. So do always exercise and training. </p>

I wanted and need to lose the weight. I am 18 years old and I weigh 190 lbs I know that doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot because everyone who says they need to lose the weight are over that but my doctor said that if I didn&#8217;t lose at least 50 lbs I would become a diabetic and I am not up to sticking myself with a needle everyday. There are days where I am like &#8220;I need to work out&#8221; or &#8220;this is too fatty but sooo good&#8221; and I really can&#8217;t go anywhere to workout cuz I live in the woods and I don&#8217;t have a car. I want to know if there is a plan similar to this that will work for me? I actually used to have this app on my phone that helped me lose ten pounds in a week because I followed it but then my phone broke and couldn&#8217;t find the app ever again.</p>

now need to start again.  but i am a drinker and love to drink wine.  so the idea of drinking on<br />
saturdays would be great.  watch all week and that be my day to drink if i want.  so hopefully<br />

I know it sounds silly but like 15 pounds of the minimum 50 I have to lose seem to be bat wings on my arms so when watching anything on a screen (be it films for school, documentaries for work or just regular old TV) I use my dumbells at the same time. Even on a bad back day (I&#8217;ve re-occuring sciatica) while your sitting down you can be exercising your arms at least. I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t do other exercises too, obviously you need a well rounded exercise plan over the course of a week but this is a great way to sneak in exercise even when you might otherwise be feeeling crappy.</p>

At first I had to force myself but after a couple of weeks it became second nature and I actually crave it and even want to continue through Colbert. I&#8217;ve been basically doing everything listed in this article, except I also aim to eat every 3 hours or so and aim for 300 calories give or take an hour and 100 calories. I&#8217;m not strict on myself and I still eat what I want, but I have noticed that by drinking the extra water, food that used to be bland is now tasting too salty for me. My stomache has shrunken and I am never hungry. I feel like I ate Thanksgiving dinner if I chow down on a 500+ calorie meal and it is a disgusting feeling.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been losing a little over 3 pounds a week and it doesn&#8217;t feel like a diet at all.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-374112" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is funny. I just read this now and have been dieting for a little over a month. I&#8217;ve actually been doing all of these things already- and it does work. The not dieting on the weekend really helps and since I have a desk job I just sip on water all day and eat &#8220;smartones&#8221; for lunch. I&#8217;ve only lost 6 lbs but I&#8217;ve chosen to take it slow. My job actually has a built in gym, which I use each morning to do a hard core workout that last 30- 60 mins. I really wanna lose 20lbs within the next 6 months. I&#8217;m just trying to tone back up after having a baby- shes now two and I&#8217;ve tried plenty of other ways of dieting and I always quit because I can live and enjoy life. Knowing that the weekends are free game give me something to look forward too. Great blog- these are really great tips.</p>

This is exactly what I was looking for.<br />
Most things I find on line are not so realistic. </p>
<p>I used to eat whatever but I worked out so I never noticed the effects of what I consumed had inside my body.<br />
I stopped working out about three months ago yet kept eating junk.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t until recently that I began to notice how unhealthy I felt.<br />
So I decided to talk to oneof my teachers about it and she was also consurned with my health so we discused what would be a good diet for me to go on.<br />
You&#8217;re article has shown me the extra help I needed.<br />
thank you and congrats(:</p>

Gastric bypass with no surgery</p>
<p>Used successfully in Europe for 6 years, this medical innovation is an<br />
easy-to-use formula that creates a natural GASTRIC BYPASS EFFECT in the<br />
stomach. Mixed with water and taken in the morning, it immediately expands in your stomach, leaving only a small limited stomach available for food intake and  practically forcing you to eat half.</p>
<p>The result: an immediate calorie deficiency and weight loss from day one. To accelerate the process, the formula includes the patented ingredient β-Glucan®,<br />
 which balances blood sugar levels and fights your cravings for sweets<br />
and snacks &#8211; something that surgery isn’t capable of. You&#8217;ll not only<br />
eat less food without feeling hungry, you&#8217;ll eat healthier too.</p>
<p>Eat half from day one<br />
While in the past you required a full meal to fill your stomach and<br />
satisfy your hunger, once you&#8217;re using the formula, you can take half a<br />
portion and still feel satisfied after. Since the formula PHYSICALLY<br />
fills your stomach, you have neither the need nor the space for more. At<br />
 the end of the day, you’ll find that even though you ate very little,<br />
you felt satisfied and your energy level remained high. Without<br />
realizing, you entered a state of calorie deficiency, where you ate fewer calories than you burned.</p>
<p>Safer and healthier than gastric bypass<br />
With over 27,000 YouTube and testimonial results, the formula is<br />
probably the strongest and fastest method in the world to lose weight<br />
giving it a 90% success rate. In comparison to gastric bypass surgery, the formula is less risky, faster, healthier, and has almost NO SIDE EFFECTS<br />
 or complications. And at the low cost of $640, it’s a fraction of the<br />
cost of gastric bypass surgery, which can be $15,000 or more.</p>
<p>With RocaLabs™ Natural Gastric Bypass Formula, you finally have the<br />
weapon you need to win the fight against hunger, cravings, and obesity.<br />
You&#8217;ll lose weight, look better, and improve your health easily and<br />
naturally. The power to succeed is in your hands.</p>

Formula based on healthy fibers<br />
RocaLabs™ Natural Formula is based on healthy fibers: β-Glucan®, Xanthan Gum, and Guar Gum. All ingredients are 100% natural.<br />
β-Glucan®: an FDA-approved ingredient for health diet that balances blood sugar levels. Imbalances in blood sugar levels cause uncontrollable cravings for sweets &amp; snacks. β-Glucan® regulates these and effectively eliminates cravings. β-Glucan®<br />
 has other benefits as well: it has been proven to reduce the risk of<br />
heart disease, lower cholesterol levels, and strengthen the immune<br />
system. For further reading, see our research page and:<br />
Beta Glucan Research<br />
Beta-glucan for Seasonal Infections<br />
XG® (Xanthan &amp; Guar Gum): These are GRAS (Generally<br />
Recognized As Safe) fibers, approved by the WHO (World Health<br />
Organization), that occupy most of the stomach, leaving only a small<br />
limited stomach volume for consumption. Activated by large amounts of<br />
water, these fibers fill your stomach for 10-16 hours. Diabetics<br />
in particular can greatly benefit from the slowed rate of sugar<br />
absorption provided by the XG® fibers. For further reading, see:<br />
XG GRAS approved<br />

Article on XG fibers and diabetics<br />
Other Ingredients</p>
<p>The formula also contains: Natural Flavors, Maltodextrin<br />
Maltodextrin: An easily digested carbohydrate that slightly raises blood sugar levels. For further reading, see:<br />

The formula also contains several USRDA-approved Vitamins, including Vitamin C, which boosts the immune system; Vitamin B6, which helps smoothen skin; and Vitamin B12, which is essential for the brain and nervous system. For further reading, see:<br />

Formula based on healthy fibers<br />
RocaLabs™ Natural Formula is based on healthy fibers: β-Glucan®, Xanthan Gum, and Guar Gum. All ingredients are 100% natural.<br />
β-Glucan®: an FDA-approved ingredient for health diet that balances blood sugar levels. Imbalances in blood sugar levels cause uncontrollable cravings for sweets &amp; snacks. β-Glucan® regulates these and effectively eliminates cravings. β-Glucan®<br />
 has other benefits as well: it has been proven to reduce the risk of<br />
heart disease, lower cholesterol levels, and strengthen the immune<br />
system. For further reading, see our research page and:<br />
Beta Glucan Research<br />
Beta-glucan for Seasonal Infections<br />
XG® (Xanthan &amp; Guar Gum): These are GRAS (Generally<br />
Recognized As Safe) fibers, approved by the WHO (World Health<br />
Organization), that occupy most of the stomach, leaving only a small<br />
limited stomach volume for consumption. Activated by large amounts of<br />
water, these fibers fill your stomach for 10-16 hours. Diabetics<br />
in particular can greatly benefit from the slowed rate of sugar<br />
absorption provided by the XG® fibers. For further reading, see:<br />

Article on XG fibers and diabetics<br />
Other Ingredients</p>
<p>The formula also contains: Natural Flavors, Maltodextrin<br />
Maltodextrin: An easily digested carbohydrate that slightly raises blood sugar levels. For further reading, see:<br />

The formula also contains several USRDA-approved Vitamins, including Vitamin C, which boosts the immune system; Vitamin B6, which helps smoothen skin; and Vitamin B12, which is essential for the brain and nervous system. For further reading, see:<br />

I would like to add that I learned to NEVER deny yourself a craving. However you should still limit your self to portions and be conscious of that. SO if you crave a brownie it&#8217;s ok to get one of those little Debbie brownies with Nuts. Just don&#8217;t eat the whole box and don&#8217;t eat it every day. I am told That having a cheat day works really well, but that falls under your advice to Not diet on weekends. It&#8217;s NOT always Possible to eat at home. You may be on vacation in a room that doesn&#8217;t have a kitchen. So just make healthy decision at the restaurant you and your friends/family choose to eat at. Even McDonalds sells salads and you can pair it with a chicken sandwhich or cheeseburger with small fries.Most importantly you MUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND YOUR GOALS!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-378274" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good tips. The water one is important. Eat 5-6 snacks a day. Keep them simple so they are easy to prepare and carry around. Good quality carbs/protein/vegetables. Palm size (or less) each of those per meal. I find exercise to be very important. Apart from making you burn energy, it makes you feel more agile, lighter, faster and stronger. Bigger muscles burns energy quicker and it supports your bones, back (very important) etc and your skin looks healthier. </p>
<p>Eating small meals per day and exercise will increase your metabolism, making you burn fat even if you don&#8217;t exercise. This 50% carbs + 50% protein diet works well with exercise. The carbs gives you energy to run faster/push more weights which makes you build muscle mass faster and increase metabolism faster. Protein is to repair muscle quicker pain doenst last as long and muscles tones faster. If you are a girl, it is VERY unlikely that your muscles will become too big. That takes a lot of work for woman to build large muscles.  For the men, you will also have to push serious weights to become big so following this plan you will likely just become very toned with low fat %. </p>
<p>For the exercise, Mon (Upper body weights), Tue (30min cardio), Wed (Lower Body weights), Thurs (30min cardio), Fri (Upper body weights), Sat (30min cardio), Sun (Cheat day. No exercise. Stuff your face with any food). Next week, swop weights around, starting lower body on Monday and keep cardio the same days.</p>
