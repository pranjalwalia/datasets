<div id="attachment_572" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-572" title="steamedbuns-7" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-7-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">bread flour, yeast, non-fat milk power, water, baking soda and water, pork fat</p></div>
<p>Momofuku still sources their steamed buns from elsewhere, so if you want to take Chang&#8217;s advice, you can easily buy plain steamed buns at most Asian grocery stores in the freezer section. The most common plain steamed bun is the mantou, which doesn&#8217;t have the sock-puppet mouth shape that Chang uses, but you can substitute it easily, just slice them open and fill.</p>
<div id="attachment_573" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-22.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-573" title="steamedbuns-22" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-22-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">dough hook kneading dough</p></div>
<p>The problem is, when you do find steamed buns that are the right sock-puppet shape they are mostly too big compared to the Momofuku steamed buns.  I highly recommend taking the time to make your own steamed buns. You can always freeze them<strong>. I froze a bunch of steamed buns and am looking forward to instant pork buns whenever my little heart desires!</strong> (Well, I guess I need to have roast pork belly on hand too, but who doesn&#8217;t have slabs of roast belly in their fridge waiting to be consumed?)</p>
<div id="attachment_574" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-32.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-574" title="steamedbuns-32" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-32-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the kitchen aid doing all the work</p></div>
<p>Really though, this is a fantastically easy snack to put together when you have everything at hand, so even though the recipe yields 50 buns, trust me, <em>you&#8217;ll eat them all</em>. I know we did!</p>
<div id="attachment_575" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-48.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-575" title="steamedbuns-48" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-48-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">balls of dough</p></div>
<p>The steamed buns are a basic bread recipe but steamed, instead of baked. Yeast, water, bread flour, sugar, non-fat milk powder, salt, baking powder, baking soda and pork fat are all kneaded together into a sticky ball and left to rise. After the dough has doubled, it&#8217;s punched down, divided into 50 balls, and left to rise again.</p>
<div id="attachment_577" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-76.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-577" title="steamedbuns-76" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-76-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">flattened ovals with chopstick to fold over</p></div>
<p>The balls are then flattened into an oval and folded over to form the floppy sock puppet mouth shape. One more rise and then they are ready to steam! (That&#8217;s three rises, just in case you were counting.)</p>
<div id="attachment_578" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-77.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-578" title="steamedbuns-77" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-77-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">sock puppet mouth shaped bun</p></div>
<p>I steamed my buns in a wok because I don&#8217;t have a bamboo steamer. Apparently bamboo steamers are ideal because steam condensation doesn&#8217;t drip down on the buns, which causes wrinkly bun skin. That was exactly what happened to me: wrinkly bun skin. Nobody wants wrinkly bun skin! My inventive solution was to stretch a tea towel over the rim of the wok so that the drops of water from the lid would catch on the towel instead of falling on to the skin. The towel trick worked, the buns were less wrinkly as the steaming progressed.</p>
<div id="attachment_579" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-89.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-579" title="steamedbuns-89" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-89-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">un-steamed buns waiting for the wok</p></div>
<p>I was also worried about the colour of the buns. They weren&#8217;t pure white, more of a very pale yellow. The buns tasted good, they just didn&#8217;t look super white, which is what I wanted, because I&#8217;m a bit of a prefectionist like that. I looked up &#8220;why are my steamed buns yellow&#8221; on google and found a little trick where you put some white vinegar in the steaming water. I tried it and (surprise surprise) it <em>didn&#8217;t </em>work.</p>
<div id="attachment_580" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 540px"><a href="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-114.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-580" title="steamedbuns-114" src="http://momofukufor2.com/blog/photos/2010/01/steamedbuns-114-530x354.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">::fluff:: buns become fluffy after steaming</p></div>
<p>Even though they were wrinkly and not pure white, they were fluffy and tasty. At least I have that! As one <a title="this is not bruce's twitter" href="http://twitter.com/thisisnotbruce" target="_blank">friend</a> said, &#8220;I could eat the [bun] just on it&#8217;s own.&#8221; (Actually he said &#8220;sponge,&#8221; but I know he meant bun.)</p>

      <p>After making the pork belly and using store bought buns, I&#8217;ve decided that this dish is just too good to not have my own little stash in the freezer. I&#8217;m going to make my own buns too&#8230;just so I can eat these little goodies whenever I want to.</p>

I tried store-bought buns too, but it just wasn&#8217;t the same. Having a stash in the freezer is great, if you don&#8217;t go through them in less than a week, which is what happened to me! Pork buns are addictive!</p>

Thanks for the tip! Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be searching out super-white flour anytime soon, but if I run across it, maybe I&#8217;ll be making some white buns!</p>

      <p>it cou;d be the flour (bleached AP) but its white&#8230;right. i think the addition of soda (baking soda) is what turns it yell-er. think about baking biscuts? or scones, certain rising agents stain dough&#8230;in some noodles&#8230;the additon of sodium chloride (sodium&#8230;salt) turns them yell-er. try the recipe without salt soda or baking powder.</p>
