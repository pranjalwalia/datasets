<p><em> </em></p>
<p>When you were a child, you may have been told to &#8220;Stand up straight!&#8221; or &#8220;Don&#8217;t slouch!&#8221; from your parents and teachers. I remember when I was younger, my mother would poke my back out of nowhere to remind me to stand up straight. I hated this as a teen and was determined to rebel for no reason other than to be stubborn and go against what I was told. My purposeful slouching eventually turned into a habit and carried with me into adulthood.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m older, I understand why my mother was so insistent. My poor posture now makes me feel:</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li><strong>Pain</strong> in my back and <strong>shoulders</strong>.</li>
<li>I am <strong>breathing shallowly.</strong></li>
<li> I appeared to <strong>lack self confidence</strong>.</li>
<li> <strong>Energy was not flowing</strong> efficiently throughout my body. I was often <strong>tired</strong>.</li>
<li> It made me look and <strong>feel weak</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have spent much time correcting the damage, and undeveloped muscles, from my rebellious teen years. Like any habit, breaking bad posture can be a challenge, but definitely doable with some attention and practice.</p>
<p>Many of us may like to improve our posture, but we often don&#8217;t know how, or where to start.</p>
<h3><span id="more-168"></span><strong>Posture 101</strong></h3>
<p>Posture is defined as the carriage of the body. Good posture means carrying your body in a way that puts the least strain on muscles and ligaments. Poor posture can cause pain in the back and neck, and eventually causes injury. Improving your posture is a great way to improve your image while at the same time improving your health.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s go over some of the things that contribute to poor posture. Most of them are fixable, and others (like pregnancy) eventually go away on their own.</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li> Poor habits &#8211; sitting and standing incorrectly (this is me)</li>
<li> Weakened muscles</li>
<li> Obesity &#8211; The extra weight strains the muscles</li>
<li> Pregnancy</li>
<li> Improper shoes &#8211; high heeled shoes are the worst</li>
<li> Reduced muscle and joint flexibility</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Good Posture</strong></h3>
<p>Good posture is beneficial to your health in several ways. Standing and sitting correctly prevents strain and overuse, and helps prevent back, neck, and muscle pain. Good posture also helps the muscles work more efficiently, which helps prevent fatigue. Most importantly, I have found that I can breathe deeply from my belly (my core). The energy I get from a deep breath is what keeps me going during the day.</p>
<p>The physical benefits are many, but there are other side benefits to good posture. When you stand properly, the body looks aligned, looks slimmer, and generally looks better. Good posture can also help you feel more confident &#8211; because you look and feel better, your confidence increases.</p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Most of us work at a desk or on a computer, and it&#8217;s very easy to slip into poor sitting habits. If your body posture is not aligned, eventually you will experience pain. Make sure you follow proper techniques for sitting, standing, and lifting. These seem obvious, but let&#8217;s list them to reflect.</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li> <strong>Sitting</strong> &#8211; Sit with your shoulders back and back straight. Your legs should be at a 90 degree angle to your body. Keep your neck, back, and heels in alignment. Avoid the urge to slouch at your desk!</li>
<li> <strong>Standing</strong> &#8211; When standing, hold your head up straight and chin slightly tucked in. Keep your shoulder blades back, chest forward, and stomach tucked in. Keep most of your weight on the balls of the feet and not the heels or toes. Your arms should hang down naturally.</li>
<li> <strong>Lifting</strong> &#8211; Lifting something off the ground by bending over forces your back to do most of the lifting and puts a strain on the lower back. The proper way to lift is to bend at the knees and not the waist. This forces your leg muscles to do most of the work.</li>
<li> <strong>Keep Your Spine Straight</strong>: In general, try to keep your spine as straight as possible at all times. No matter what you&#8217;re doing, if you&#8217;re conscious of the alignment of your back and neck, you will notice that your posture will improve.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Simple Stretches to Loosen Your Back Muscles</strong></h3>

</div>

<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li> <strong>Lower back cat stretch</strong>: This stretch is done on all fours, fingers facing forward. Start by dropping your head and raising your back as you push the shoulder blades upward. Repeat in the opposite direction by pushing your chest downward, arching your lower back.</li>
<li> <strong>Knees to chest</strong>: While lying on your back, pull both knees to the chest with your hands behind your knees. Keep your tailbone on the floor and hold this stretch for at least 15 seconds.</li>
<li> <strong>Shoulder blade squeeze:</strong> Have arms straight out in front of you at shoulder height. Now swing both arms horizontally towards your back, like you are trying to reconnect your fingers behind your back. Swing your arms back to the front. Do this motion slowly several times.</li>
<li> <strong>Shoulder blade lift</strong>: Have arms straight out in front of you at shoulder height. Now swing both arms vertically in opposite directions. Keep arms straight. Do this motion slowly several times.</li>
<li> <strong>The Core Twist</strong>: Hold arms out, bent at shoulder height. Feet planted on the ground, toes facing forward. Keeping your hips facing forward, twist your upper body towards the back (try to look behind you). Twist from side to side. Twist baby! Twist!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Exercises to Strengthen Your Back Muscles</strong></h3>
<p>Any type of exercise will benefit you by improving muscle endurance and increasing strength. Exercises that strengthen your core are the most helpful for improving and building the muscles that lead to good posture. Your core is your torso &#8211; shoulders to hips &#8211; the source of all your strength to your limbs. Here are three exercises that help improve posture:</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li> <strong>Back extensions</strong>: Lying face down on the floor with hands behind head. Slowly lift your upper body a few inches off the ground and hold for 5 seconds. Slowly lower to the ground. Repeat 10 &#8211; 12 times.</li>
<li> <strong>Superman</strong>: Lying face down on the floor, lift your right arm and left leg off the floor several inches. Hold for two seconds and then lower. Repeat with left arm and right leg. Do 10-12 repetitions.</li>
<li> <strong>Shoulder Squeeze</strong>: Lift shoulders toward ears and squeeze together, holding the position for five seconds. Relax and repeat 3-5 times.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Tips for Good Posture </strong></h3>
<p><em> </em></p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li> <strong>Pad Your Chair</strong> &#8211; Consider adding lumbar support pad to your office chair. I have a pretty economical cotton pad for my office chair. In fact, I use two of these. This drives other people crazy, since there isn&#8217;t much room on the chair, but it&#8217;s great for my posture.</li>
<li> <strong>Push Butt Towards Back of Chair</strong> &#8211; When sitting, I find it helpful to remind myself to shift my butt towards the back of the chair. This helps to prevent me from slouching, as long as I continue to lean forward.</li>
<li> <strong>Sit on Tip of Chair </strong>- When you are sitting on the tip of your chair, you are further from the back of the chair so you are less likely to lean against the back support and slouch.</li>
<li> <strong>Breaks &amp; Use of Timer</strong> &#8211; if you are sitting down most of the day, make a point to get up for breaks often. I set a timer for 40 minutes, when it goes off, I stop working, get up and stretch. Alternatively, go for a walk.</li>
<li> <strong>Exercise Ball </strong>- Try replacing your chair with an exercise ball. Lean, mean and cost-effective. The exercise ball makes a nice tool for stretching out your back as well. Two birds with one stone, that&#8217;s how I roll! (haha, get it? Roll with a ball?) :)</li>

                 <blockquote><p>Ah&#8230; just great! I&#8217;m 1.84m (6 Ft 2) but because I didn&#8217;t take notice of posture when I was younger, now I tend to slouch naturally. I have to take extra effort to &#8220;stand up straight&#8221; consciously. Being tall is good. Slouching is not =P</p>

<p>I have a terrible pain at my back today and here comes your post on the right time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting with correct posture but I did not take a break in these 2 days which cause my neck and shoulders in pain.</p>
<p>How about lying on the bed (chest down) reading a book or working with my laptop. Will that be bad for my back too?</p>
<p>Thank you for your post again.</p>

                 <blockquote><p>Timely post!  A have new, younger friend who is a physical therapist.  She reminds me to hold my shoulders back.  My parents used to tell me to stand up straight, but I never really thought about holding my shoulders back.  Last time I saw my friend, I complained about how sore my muscles were (from trying to follow her instruction.)  I&#8217;m still working at it because I think slouching ages my appearance (in addition to the other outcomes you mentioned.)</p>
<p>So, thanks for the reinforcement and the tips!</p>
<p>P.S.  I recently discovered your blog, and enjoy it very much.</p>

                 <blockquote><p>I have serious spinal problems (since childhood) that caused constant and severe sciatic pain for over ten years. Now I have a partial paralysis of my left lower leg due to nerve damage in the spine. </p>
<p>In spite of this I stayed fit as a fiddle when I could. I was a runner; a cyclist, and I have practiced Tai Chi and Chi Gung for over 20 years. </p>
<p>The most important things to remember are posture, and body mechanics especially while bending or lifting. The most important posture tip I could offer is to learn the &#8220;pelvic tilt&#8221; so thoroughly that it becomes natural posture for you. If you have a serious issue with your spine, I would really recommend learning Tai Chi Chuan if you can find a good teacher. Tai Chi helps you learn strong but relaxed movement using proper body mechanics. </p>
<p>Otherwise &#8212; everything Tina said :-)</p>

                 <blockquote><p>Raymond,</p>
<p>Lying on your stomach reading or working on your lap top is likely to cause problems. It arches and compresses the lumbar vertebrae where most people have issues. You can read lying on your back, with your head and shoulders supported up a bit, but ensure that you pull your feet up and bend your legs. That way the lumbar area is decompressed. </p>
<p>As an exercise, try gentle slow movement of the spine while standing. Move gently, very slowly, breathe calmly and deeply as you twist and undulate your spine. Move your shoulders and arms also. basically just get carried off into your body as if it were made of rubber. If you are doing it right, it should feel sensual and delicious. </p>
<p>Try it :-)</p>
<p>John</p>

                 <blockquote><p>good posture at an early age also contributes to height increase. i also have bad posture and continually try to correct when i&#8217;m sitting down or standing around &#8211; it is a pain sometimes but it actually helps me stay away and focused on work when i sit straight. i also find push ups and sitting against a wall at a 90 degree angle to be good exercises for improving posture</p>

<p>you want to learn how to use your psoas muscle to anchor your lower spine, and always visualize lengthening your spine when doing these stretches given above, or you end up compressing the front or back of it. learn to keep your ribs lifted and full, and breathe with your diaphragm. if you have to lean in to see your monitor, move it closer; keep your hips under your shoulders, and don&#8217;t always have your feet bunched up under the chair or your legs lose energy. visualize a triangle with the top of your head and your shoulders at the corners; lean your head forward and pull your shoulders back, and make all three sides of the triangle longer, by filling them with inhales.</p>

Depending on where you situate your hands, you&#8217;ll get a great stretch in various sections of your back. (NOTE: it&#8217;s like the cat stretch, only standing up.)</p>

<p>I came to your site looking for good material in the office, and I actually found something I could contribute greatly to!</p>
<p>Great article on posture! Every technological convenience seems to just compound our posture problems in society&#8230;&#8230;. </p>
<p>There is one other cause of a posture misalignment that I&#8217;d like to mention here. STRUCTURE. In some individuals, their spine is actually misaligned in an abnormal posture. For example, from the front, the entire spine may be shifted to the left or right. From the side, a person&#8217;s middle back may be too far forward, or more commonly, too far backward, causing that commonly seen and called &#8216;humpback.&#8217; The other common posture abnormality in our society is the forward head posture. This can actually be measured and compared to &#8216;normal&#8217; limits.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the priviledge of working with/for this clinic that specializes in postural abnormalities for over a year now. I have seen pre and post xrays showing actual improvement with patient&#8217;s posture and effectively easing a lot of people&#8217;s pain. The technique is called Clinical Biomechanics of Posture (CBP), if you want to do some more research. In addition to being the Rehabilitation Assistant, I have also been a patient and where I once had frequent migraines and absolutely 0 degrees of curve in my neck, I now have an (almost) healthy 24 degrees of curve and no migraine since April &#8217;07.</p>
<p>Be informed.</p>
<p>Happy and healthy spines mean happy and healthy nervous systems!</p>

                 <blockquote><p>I believe that if we pay the proper attention to <a href="http://www.martialdevelopment.com/blog/three-benefits-from-lifting-your-bai-hui-point/" rel="nofollow">lifting the top of our head</a> (not our chin), that many of our postural problems will automatically be resolved.</p>
<p>At times, I have literally spent hours practicing this one point and nothing else.  It is a &#8220;secret&#8221; of internal martial arts training.</p>

                 <blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll heartily recond Ryan&#8217;s suggestion re: The Alexander Technique. Tips and tricks are great, but addressing the underlying habitual usage issues is a) the only way to lasting results (IMHO), and b) a hell of a lot harder. I&#8217;ll just say that my results with a lower back problem resisted: yoga, meditation, chiropractors, and stretching. AT is nailing it, though.</p>

                 <blockquote><p>Tina &#8211; One way to set yourself up for success, at least while driving, is to arrange your mirrors and seat in a way that you need to use good posture.   It&#8217;s a simple tip, but my cousin the chiropractor says its one of those simple things that actually works, particularly if you spend a lot of time in the car.  It&#8217;s a constant reminder.</p>
<p>If you sit behind a computer all day, it&#8217;s important to have the monitor higher than you would expect.  You should literally be looking up enough that your head is slightly back &#8212; enough to bend you neck backward vs. forward.  The curve in your neck is key.  If you&#8217;re losing your curve, one thing you can do is find a chiropractor or other source for an exercise pump for your neck that helps you improve your curve.</p>

<p>I just read this book and it has helped a lot. I had lower back pain and my shoulders were rounded but this book has helped me understand how my posture is linked to back pain. The book also has great lower back exercises and stretches, its definately the best resource iv&#8217;e found among back pain cures.</p>
<p>Hope you find it helpful as well!</p>

                 <blockquote><p>Lots of great information for better posture and reducing back pain. Another great stretch for the back is knees to the chest while sitting on your knees and extending your arms out with your hands on the floor.</p>
<p>I also think planks are great strengthening exercises.</p>

                 <blockquote><p>Great Tips, Tina. Thank you.<br />
I suffered from pain in my back during my late teens.<br />
What helped me most in trying to maintain a healthy posture is trying to reach the ceiling with the top of my head. That way I automatically stand up straight and sit in a good posture. </p>
<p>And no &#8211; I don&#8217;t jump up and down all day long ;)</p>

                 <blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Purchased an ab mat and did situps to help out with my posture before. I did alot of things before I found this great way that really helped me out.</p>
<p>Yoga was also very helpful when I started it because certainly for prolonged exercise, it really helps ones posture for long term effect.</p>
<p>Some of my friends needed to hear it from the expert and they really got great advise. Just feel free to take a peak of an experts site on posture, and you will get the answer.</p>
<p>Thank&#8217;s, all the best for those who are still looking for the best cure!!</p>
