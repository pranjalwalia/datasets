        Motivation: 14 Ways To Maintain A Sharp Mind</div>
    <h1>14 Research-Proven Ways To Boost Brain Power</h1>
    <div id="lcol">
    <p>Until just a few years ago, doctors believed that the brain stopped 
      making new neural connections - meaning that the memory began to get irreversibly 
      worse - when the body stopped developing, usually in the early 20s. And 
      doctors knew that, like any other part of the body, neurons weaken as people age. Loss of 
      brain function due to neural breakdown was assumed to be a normal, unavoidable 
      part of aging. It turns out they were wrong.</p>
    <p>In the past few years, it has 
      become clear that you can, in fact, make new neurons starting in your 20s 
      and continuing well into old age. You can literally rewire the brain with 
      new parts as the older parts wear out. How?</p>
    <p>There are lots of things you can do right now to preserve, protect and 
      enhance your gray matter.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">1</span><b class="point">Physical exercise</b></p>
    <div class="rimg"><img src="/tips/img/exercise.jpg" width="200" height="300"></div>
    <p>A healthy body really does mean a healthy mind. In the last decade it became 
      clear that regular exercise beneficially affects brain function. Exercise 
      boosts brain power by stimulating formation of new brain cells (neurons), 
      the process known as neurogenesis<span id="ref"><a href="#ref2">2</a></span>. 
      Also, exercise strengthens connections between those cells. Researchers 
      have found the areas of the brain that are stimulated through exercise are 
      associated with memory and learning<span id="ref"><a href="#ref1">1</a></span>.</p>
    <p>Physical exercise 
      may even help prevent Alzheimer's disease. Several studies<span id="ref"><a href="#ref7">7</a>-<a href="#ref9">9</a></span> 
      have confirmed that regular physical activity reduces the risk of 
      cognitive decline and dementia in old age.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">2</span><b class="point">Lifelong learning - your 
      brain is a learning machine</b></p>
    <p>For most of us, after we graduate from high school or college, our pursuit 
      of new knowledge bottoms out over time. We may be masters at what we do, 
      but we aren't learning new things. There is clear evidence<span id="ref"><a href="#ref10">10</a>-<a href="#ref11">11</a></span> 
      that education and learning produce favourable changes in the brain. Researchers 
      believe that intellectual activity play a neuroprotective role against dementia. 
      Some studies suggest that having a low level of formal education and poor 
      linguistic skills is a risk factor for cognitive decline in later life.</p>
    <p>But if you continue 
      to learn and challenge yourself, your brain continues to grow, literally. 
      Recent research<span id="ref"><a href="#ref12">12</a></span> have demonstrated 
      that learning over time enhances memory and the survival of new brain cells. 
      An active brain produces new connections between nerve cells 
      that allow cells to communicate with one another. This helps your brain 
      store and retrieve information more easily, no matter what your age. </p>
    <div class="rimg"><img src="/tips/img/piano.jpg" width="250" height="171"></div>
    <p>How can you challenge yourself? Scientists agree 
      that anything that is new and expands your 
      knowledge will be effective:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning to play a musical instrument</li>
      <li>Switching careers or starting a new one</li>
      <li>Starting a new hobby, such as crafts, painting, biking or bird-watching</li>
      <li>Learning a foreign language. According to the latest <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18361656">study</a> 
        speaking more than one language may slow the aging process in the mind.</li>
      <li>Staying informed about what's going on in the world</li>
      <li>Learning to cook new dish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you let your brain be idle, it's not going to be in the best health.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">3</span><b class="point">Mental stimulation</b></p>
    <div class="ifacts">
      <p>Researchers found that a woman's memory can be impaired for at least 
        a year after giving birth, although the effects are minor</p>
    </div>  
    <p>Stimulate your brain. Make sure you're actively problem-solving and having 
      to use your memory. Just as physical activity keeps your body strong, mental 
      activity keeps your mind sharp and agile. The more we think, the better 
      our brains function - regardless of age. Without something to keep us mentally 
      charged, our brains, like unused muscles, can atrophy, leading to a decline 
      in cognitive abilities.</p>
    <p>The study<span id="ref"><a href="#ref6">6</a></span>, conducted by researchers 
      at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, found that mentally 
      active seniors reduced their risk of dementia by as much as 75 percent, 
      compared to those who do not stimulate their minds. Researchers from the 
      Princeton University<span id="ref"><a href="#ref13">13</a></span> found 
      that simple cognitive stimulation such as Bingo can be of great value to 
      the daily management of Alzheimer's patients.</p>
    <div class="rimg"><img src="/tips/img/newspaper.jpg" width="250" height="183"></div>
    <p>Some good ways to stimulate your mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Travel</li>
      <li>Going to museums</li>
      <li>Reading books, newspapers, or magazines</li>
      <li>Play 'thinking' games like cards, checkers, chess, crosswords, sudoku 
        puzzles</li>
      <li>Scrabble or doing crossword puzzles</li>
      <li>Playing musical instruments</li>
      <li>Dancing</li>
      <li>Crafts such as drawing, painting, and ceramics</li>
      <li>Ditch the calculator once in while and forcing yourself to do the calculation</li>
      <li>Volunteering</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">4</span><b class="point">Social interaction - People 
      are good medicine</b></p>
    <p>"Social interaction" can be measured by how often people talk on the phone 
      with friends, neighbors and relatives, how often they get together with 
      them, how many people they can share their most private feelings and concerns 
      with. </p>
    <div class="ifacts">
      <p>Men are one and a half times more likely than women to develop mild 
        cognitive impairment (the transition stage before dementia), <a href="http://www.aan.com/press/index.cfm?fuseaction=release.view&amp;release=596">new 
        research</a> shows.</p>
    </div>  
    <p>Socializing may have a protective effect 
      on the brain because it's a form of mental exercise. Not only does interacting 
      with people stimulate the brain, but it can also keep you sharp, because dealing with people can be pretty challenging. Strong 
      social ties have been associated with lower blood pressure and longer life 
      expectancies.</p>
    <p>And having no social ties is believed to be an 
      independent risk factor for cognitive decline in older persons.</p>
    <p>A U.S. team found<span id="ref"><a href="#ref14">14</a></span> that talking 
      to another person for 10 minutes a day improves memory and test scores. 
      They found that socializing was just as effective as more traditional kinds 
      of mental exercise in boosting memory and intellectual performance. They also
      found that the higher the level of social interaction, the better the 
      cognitive functioning. Social interaction included getting together or having 
      phone chats with relatives, friends and neighbors.</p>
    <p>In a study of more than 2,800 people ages 65 or older, Harvard researchers<span id="ref"><a href="#ref15">15</a></span> 
      found that those with at least five social ties - church groups, social groups, 
      regular visits, or phone calls with family and friends - were less likely 
      to suffer cognitive decline than those with no social ties.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">5</span><b class="point">Sleep &amp; Nap</b></p>
    <p>Sleep plays a crucial role in brain development and growth. </p>
    <div class="rimg"><img src="/tips/img/sleep.jpg" width="250" height="186"></div>
    <p>One of the explanations the science has come up with for the healing power 
      of sleep is that sleep may contribute to neurogenesis, the formation of 
      new nerve cells in the brain<span id="ref"><a href="#ref14">16</a></span>. 
      New research in animals<span id="ref"><a href="#ref14">17</a></span> provides 
      a clue about how the sleep deprivation harm the brains - reduces the number 
      of new brain cells. Without sufficient sleep, neurons may not have time 
      to repair all the damage, and so could malfunction during the day.</p>
    <p>Sleep is necessary for the brain to process and consolidate knowledge and 
      for memories to form. Neuroscientists say that during sleep the hippocampus 
      (where memory is stored) becomes highly active and moves knowledge from 
      short-term memory to long-term memory<span id="ref"><a href="#ref18">18</a>-<a href="#ref19">19</a></span>. 
      </p>
    <p>The memories laid down by the sleeping brain are of two kinds. Declarative 
      memory is memory for information - facts, dates, and names. Procedural memory 
      is what allows us to do things like play a musical instrument, ride a bicycle, 
      or add up a bill. Scientists think these two types of memory are influenced 
      by different parts of the sleep cycle. Slow wave sleep benefit mainly the 
      consolidation of declarative memories. In contrast, rapid eye movement (REM) 
      sleep seems to benefit procedural memory<span id="ref"><a href="#ref20">20</a></span>.</p>
    <div class="ifacts">
      <p>A 45-minute midday nap can help boost your memory and remember facts, 
        but only if you learned them well in the first place<span id="ref"><a href="#ref5">5</a></span>. 
      </p>
    </div>  
    <p> According to animal studies, when you perform a task, the brain cells 
      fire in a certain sequence. If you then fall asleep, the same cells automatically 
      fire in an identical sequence without being distracted or disrupted by incoming 
      visual stimuli.</p>
    <p>There is a consistent pattern: Learn something new during the day, consolidate 
      what you have learned during a good night's sleep, then remember or perform 
      the task better in the morning. However, sleep before learning is also critical 
      in preparing the brain for next-day memory formation<span id="ref"><a href="#ref21">21</a></span>. 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Even a nap in the middle of the day may benefit some learning, according 
      to a recent study<span id="ref"><a href="#ref5">5</a></span>. Sleep appears 
      to help "set" the declarative memories and make them easier to recall.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">6</span><b class="point">Stress management</b></p>
    <div class="ifacts">
      <p>The brain uses 20 percent of our body's oxygen and 20 percent of its blood.</p>
    </div>  
    <p>Scientists believe people exposed 
      to chronic stress tend to have elevated levels of cortisol - a hormone produced 
      by the adrenal glands in response to acute and chronic stress. High cortisol 
      levels are dangerous to the brain.</p>
    <p>Some of the most impressive effects of the stress on brain are hippocampus 
      atrophy, shrinkage of the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex (the area of 
      the brain unique to humans), and even neural death in some brain regions<span id="ref"><a href="#ref24">24</a>, 
      <a href="#ref28">28</a></span>. The hippocampus, a vital brain region for 
      episodic, spatial, and contextual memory, has many cortisol receptors, which 
      makes it especially susceptible to stress.</p>
    <p>Severe stress lasting weeks or months can impair 
      cell communication in the brain's learning and memory region<span id="ref"><a href="#ref27">27</a></span>. 
      Increased stress hormones lead to memory impairment in the elderly and learning 
      difficulties in young adults<span id="ref"><a href="#ref26">26</a></span>.</p>
    <div class="rimg"><img src="/tips/img/yoga.jpg" width="250" height="213"></div>
    <p>Latest study provides the evidence that short-term stress has the same 
      effect. Researcher from the University of California<span id="ref"><a href="#ref25">25</a></span> 
      have found short-term stress lasting as little as a few hours can impair 
      brain-cell communication in areas associated with learning and memory. They 
      found that rather than involving the widely known stress hormone cortisol, 
      which circulates throughout the body, acute stress activated selective molecules 
      called corticotropin releasing hormones, which disrupted the process by 
      which the brain collects and stores memories. </p>
    <p>Stress is a constant in our lives and cannot be avoided. So, stress management 
      is the key, not stress elimination.
    Several ways to help you manage stress in your daily life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>See problems as opportunities</li>
      <li>Get away from the noise</li>
      <li>Exercise</li>
      <li>Learn relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation</li>
      <li>Cut down on unnecessary responsibilities and avoid over-scheduling</li>
      <li>Make time for leisure activities </li>
      <li>Get a massage</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="snumber">7</span><b class="point">Laugh &amp; Humor</b></p>
    <div class="rimg"><img src="/tips/img/laugh.jpg" width="250" height="178"></div>
    <p>Laughter is the best medicine! We've heard the 
      expression time and again. Medical world has begun to take more serious 
      notice of the healing power of humor and the positive emotions associated 
      with it. By having fun and 
      laughing, your stress levels decrease significantly. Humor stimulates the 
      parts of our brain that use the "feel good" chemical messenger dopamine<span id="ref"><a href="#ref41">41</a></span>. 
      Also, researchers found that humor improves memory<span id="ref"><a href="#ref39">39</a>-<a href="#ref40">40.</a></span> 
    </p>
    <p><span class="snumber">8</span><b class="point">Healthy breakfast</b></p>
    <p>It might be the last thing on your morning to-do list, or it might not 
      be on your list at all. However, many studies have shown that having breakfast 
      improves the ability of concentration, reaction time, learning ability, 
      mood and memory, whereas skipping breakfast reduces people's performance 
      at school and at work<span id="ref"><a href="#ref42">42</a>, <a href="#ref43">43</a></span>.</p>
    <p>A recent study done at 
      Cardiff University in Wales found that subjects who ate a high-fiber cereal 
      in the morning showed a 10 percent reduction in fatigue, lower incidence 
      of depression, and better cognitive skills. Fiber helps slow down the absorption 
      of food in the stomach, so you have more energy for a longer period of time.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">9</span><b class="point">Omega-3 fatty acids</b></p>
    <div class="ifacts">
      <p>High intake of omega-6 rich oils (such as sunflower or grape seed oil) 
        may boost the risk of developing memory problems, say French researchers<span id="ref"><a href="#ref4">4</a></span>. 
      </p>
    </div>  
    <p> Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain health - they provide the 
      physical building blocks necessary for the development and maintenance of 
      the structural and functional integrity of the brain. In fact, one of the 
      omega-3 fatty acids, commonly known as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), makes 
      up a large portion of the gray matter in the brain and is vital for brain 
      cells function. Adding more DHA to your brain directly influences cell-to-cell 
      communication, affects nerve conduction and neurotransmitter release, and 
      other things that allow brain cells to send messages to each other<span id="ref"><a href="#ref29">29</a></span>. 
      One 1999 review of studies on DHA, published in the journal Pharmacological 
      Research<span id="ref"><a href="#ref32">32</a></span>, found that the nutrient 
      is essential to normal brain function, and that a diet rich in DHA improves 
      learning, while a lack of DHA causes learning ability to suffer. </p>
    <p>French researchers<span id="ref"><a href="#ref4">4</a></span> looked at 
      the diets of 8,085 people older than 65 who did not have dementia at the 
      start of the study. Over the following four years, 183 of the participants 
      developed Alzheimer's disease, and 98 developed another form of dementia. 
      People who regularly consumed omega-3 rich oils, such as canola, flaxseed, 
      and walnut oil, were 60 percent less likely to develop dementia than those 
      who did not regularly consume such oils. The study also found that regular 
      consumption of fruits and vegetables lowered dementia risk by 30 percent. 
      People who ate fish at least once a week were 40 percent less likely to 
      develop dementia.</p>
    <p>Coldwater fish, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, and herring are rich sources 
      of omega-3 fatty acids (just be careful to eat this in moderation due to 
      potential contamination with mercury). Dutch studies<span id="ref"><a href="#ref30">30</a>-<a href="#ref31">31</a></span> 
      revealed that high fish consumption may reduce the risk of dementia and 
      cognitive decline. </p>
    <p><span class="snumber">10</span><b class="point">Blueberries</b></p>
    <div class="rimg"><img src="/tips/img/blueberry.jpg" width="250" height="185"></div>
    <p>Would you believe that eating this tasty, low-glycemic superfood every 
      day was found by the USDA at Tufts University<span id="ref"><a href="#ref33">33</a>-<a href="#ref35">35</a></span> 
      to slow and even reverse age-related brain decline, as well as improve short-term 
      memory loss and help reverse age-related loss of balance?!</p>
    <p>Blueberries are a major source of flavonoids, in particular anthocyanins 
      and flavanols. Although the precise mechanisms by which these plant-derived 
      molecules affect the brain are unknown, they have been shown to cross the 
      blood brain barrier after dietary intake. It is believed that they exert 
      their effects on learning and memory by enhancing existing neuronal 
      connections, improving cellular communications and stimulating neuronal 
      regeneration. </p>
    <p><span class="snumber">11</span><b class="point">Vegetables</b></p>
    <p>Researchers found that eating vegetables appears to help keep the brain 
      young and may slow the mental decline sometimes associated with growing 
      old<span id="ref"><a href="#ref22">22</a></span>. Cruciferous and green 
      leafy vegetables including cauliflower, spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage, 
      brussels sprout and collards appear to be the most beneficial<span id="ref"><a href="#ref23">23</a></span>. 
      Researchers say that may be because they contain healthy amounts of 
      vitamin E, an antioxidant that is believed to help fight chemicals produced 
      by the body that can damage cells.</p>
    <p>Three B vitamins, folic acid, B6, and B12, can help lower your homocysteine 
      levels. Fortified cereal, other grains, and leafy green vegetables are good 
      sources of B vitamins. 
    </p>
    <p><span class="snumber">12</span><b class="point">Want to drink? Choose 
      red wine!</b></p>
    <div class="ifacts">
      <p>People who drink to forget bad memories may actually be doing the opposite 
        by reinforcing the neural circuits that control negative emotional memory<span id="ref"><a href="#ref3">3</a></span></p>
    </div>  
    <p>While heavy drinking clearly causes serious problems for many people, drinking 
      in moderation may be good for the brain. </p>
    <p>Researchers found, intake of up to three daily servings of wine, unlike 
      other alcohol beverages (liquor, beer), was associated with a lower risk 
      of dementia<span id="ref"><a href="#ref37">37</a></span>. This may be due 
      to the ability of red wine polyphenols to protect brain cells
      against alcohol-induced damage<span id="ref"><a href="#ref38">38</a></span>. 
      There is well-documented evidence that resveratrol, a polyphenol found in 
      red wine and red grape skin and seeds, has a significant antioxidant properties 
      and produces neuroprotective effects<span id="ref"><a href="#ref36">36</a></span>.

    <p>Many medical conditions, particularly those identified as risk factors 
      for cardiovascular disease, are also risk factors for cognitive decline 
      and dementia.</p>
    <p><b>High blood pressure</b><br>
      High blood pressure in midlife increases the risk of cognitive decline in 
      old age<span id="ref"><a href="#ref44">44</a></span>. Use lifestyle modification 
      to lower your blodd pressure.</p>
    <p><b>Diabetes</b><br>
      Diabetes is an important risk factor for dementia<span id="ref"><a href="#ref45">45</a></span>. 
      You can improve blood glucose levels by eating healthy diet, exercising 
      regularly, and staying lean. But if your blood sugar stays high, you'll 
      need medication to achieve good control.</p>
    <p><b>High cholesterol</b><br>
      High levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol appear to significantly increase 
      the risk of dementia<span id="ref"><a href="#ref46">46</a></span>. Diet, 
      exercise, weight control, and avoiding tobacco will go a long way toward 
      improving your cholesterol levels. </p>
    <p><b>High homocysteine</b><br>
      Research has shown that a higher than average blood level of homocysteine 
      - a type of amino acid - is a strong risk factor for the development of 
      Alzheimer disease and dementia<span id="ref"><a href="#ref47">47</a></span>.</p>
    <p><span class="snumber">14</span><b class="point">Neurobics</b></p>
    <p>Created by Lawrence C. Katz, Ph.D., a professor of neurobiology at Duke 
      University Medical Center, neurobics is a unique system of brain exercises 
      using your five physical senses and your emotional sense in unexpected ways 
      that encourage you to shake up your everyday routines. Studies have shown 
      that even small changes in daily patterns cause brain stimulation. </p>
    <p>Neurobics can be done anywhere, anytime, in offbeat, fun and easy ways. 
      These exercises can activate underused nerve pathways and connections, helping 
      you achieve a fit and flexible mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drive to work a different route</li>
      <li>Get dressed with your eyes closed</li>
      <li>Brush your teeth with the other hand</li>
      <li>Unlock the door with your eyes closed</li>
      <li>Use your opposite hand to dial the phone or operate the TV remote</li>
      <li>Listen to music and smell flowers at the same time</li>
      <li>Shop at new grocery store</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Research has suggested that using your left hand if you're left handed or your right 
      if you're left handed more often, can help stimulate parts of the brain that you don't 
      normally use. </p>
