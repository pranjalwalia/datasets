You are welcome.  Trust me.  </p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p>
<p><strong>Crispy Peanut Butter Marshmallow Truffle Eggs</strong><br />
makes about 2 dozen (depending on the size)</p>
<p>1 cup creamy peanut butter<br />
4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature<br />
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
1 1/2 cups confectioners&#8217; sugar<br />
2 cups puffed rice cereal<br />
1/2 cup marshmallow creme</p>
<p>chocolate for dipping</p>
<p>I used a mixer for this, but you could totally do this by hand if you feel you need a workout.  <img src='http://www.stephanieskitchen.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   Cream the peanut butter and butter.  Add the vanilla extract.  Mix in the confectioners&#8217; sugar and than add the puffed rice cereal.  Don&#8217;t over mix that too hard so it stays crispy.  Stir in the marshmallow cream.  It will have a marbled effect which is just what you want.  Use a regular sized ice cream scoop and scoop the peanut butter mixture onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets.  Shape into egg shapes.  Or leave in a round ball.  Totally your preference.  Freeze for about 1 hour.  Melt your chocolate and dip the eggs into the chocolate.  Place on the parchment paper.  Let the chocolate set.  I put some melted white chocolate on top to make it extra pretty.  Enjoy!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the new Stephanie&#8217;s Kitchen!  I am so excited to have this all done and show you guys!  It has been so much fun to see it come to life.  It took a while for the whole process to be complete and then with all of my fabulous luck that I was born with, someone hacked into the server that holds the website!  Can you even believe it? It threatened everything that had been done on it, but I do have some luck because I am married to a computer genius and he was able to save it.  Yay!  So drama behind us, here we are.  </p>
<p>Thank you so much for all of your sweet comments this last week.  And just so everyone knows, my daughter is doing perfect, the dog is doing great and everyone is happy (at the moment).  </p>
<p>So onto the cupcakes.  These were amazing!  I had never had caramel frosting before, but had heard of it recently so I decided to try my hand at it.  It was so tasty and the perfect addition to these light and fluffy cupcakes.  So if you have some ripe bananas sitting on your countertop like I do all the time, give these a try!  Don&#8217;t tell anyone, but I didn&#8217;t frost half of them and fed them to my kids for breakfast.  After all, cupcakes without frosting are just muffins, right? </p>
<p>Have a great week everyone!</p>
<p><strong>Banana Cupcakes w/Caramel Frosting</strong><br />
makes about 2 dozen</p>
<p>2 1/2 cups cake flour (or just add 1 tablespoon cornstarch per 1 cup of all purpose flour)<br />
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
1 cup butter, at room temperature<br />
1 1/4 cups sugar<br />
3 eggs<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla<br />
2/3 cup milk<br />
1 cup mashed ripe banana</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.  Using a mixer, cream the butter and sugar.  Add eggs, one at a time until well incorporated.  Mix in the vanilla and milk.  Slowly add the flour mixture and mix until smooth and creamy.  Fold in the mashed bananas.  Line 24 muffin cups with cupcake liners.  Equally distribute the batter between the muffin cups.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 18-20 minutes.  Frost with caramel frosting, add mini chocolate chips to the batter before baking or just eat plain.  </p>
<p><strong>Caramel Frosting</strong></p>
<p>5 tablespoons butter<br />
1/3 cup brown sugar<br />
3 tablespoons milk<br />
1 1/2 cup confectioners&#8217; sugar</p>
<p>In a medium saucepan, bring the butter and brown sugar to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir in the milk.  Let sit to cool for about 30 minutes.  Whisk in the confectioners&#8217; sugar and mix until smooth.  Add more sugar if needed to get a frosting consistency.  </p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The last 2 weeks at my house have been really crazy.  We spent a week at Disneyland only to come home to a dog who had been attacked very badly at the kennel and then to a very sick little baby girl who ended up having a 3 day hospital stay due to RSV and pneumonia.  So I have been very glad to have all of that out of the way and onto brighter days.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Baking is my release.  It calms me and it seems to help the stress melt away.  I don&#8217;t care what anyone says, there is nothing like a warm chocolate chip cookie or a fresh chocolate cupcake to help you out of a bad day (or week). I don&#8217;t care about the calories. Okay sometimes I do, (but really I don&#8217;t).</p>

<p>I am not a candy bar lover.  I would rather waist my calories on a huge slice of chocolate cake.  But I have to admit that I have a soft spot for Reese&#8217;s Peanut Butter Cups.  As I was strolling through the grocery store through the junk food isle, my eye was drawn to this bad boy&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1347" href="http://www.stephanieskitchen.com/2011/03/loaded-peanut-butter-cookies/reese-milk-chocolate-filled-with-reeses-peanut-butter-4-25-oz-120/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1347" title="reese-milk-chocolate-filled-with-reeses-peanut-butter-4-25-oz-120" src="http://www.stephanieskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/reese-milk-chocolate-filled-with-reeses-peanut-butter-4-25-oz-120.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="216" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, I couldn&#8217;t resist, because I have no self control.  I can happily admit that one.  So i decided to smash it on top of these irrisistable peanut butter oatmeal cookies I baked up.  Seriously so good.  If you can track this candy bar down, try it.  I found it in the candy bar isle near the gourmet chocolate bars.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Have an amazingly delicious week!</p>
<p><strong>Loaded Peanut Butter Cookies</strong></p>
<p>2 1/4 cups all purpose flour<br />
1 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
1 cup butter, at room temperature<br />
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter<br />
1/2 cup sugar<br />
1 cup brown sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
1 3.4 ounce package instant vanilla pudding mix<br />
1 1/2 cups old fashioned oatmeal<br />
1/2 cup peanut butter chips<br />
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips<br />
2 bars Reese&#8217;s Milk Chocolate Bar filled with Peanut Butter (see photo)</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.  Using a mixer, cream the butter, peanut butter and sugar until smooth and creamy.  Add the eggs, vanilla and pudding mix.  Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to get everything incorporated.  Slowly add the flour mixture.  Stir in the oatmeal, peanut butter chips, and chocolate chips. Scoop extra large amounts of dough onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Bake at 350 degrees for 9-11 minutes or until just lightly golden.  Take out of the oven and immediately put one square of the Reese&#8217;s bar and press down just a bit.  Try not to eat the whole batch!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>xoxox,</p>
<p>Steph</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">My kids have been running around the house like chickens with their heads cut off.  Tornados really.  I don&#8217;t know if it is because we got our usual winter snowstorm in early spring, or if they are just tired of being in the house.  Maybe a combination of both.  Maybe because they are anxiously awaiting their very first trip to Disneyland that is just around the corner.  But whatever the reason, it is driving me MAD!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what does a Mom do when her kids are running around screaming and beating each other with wooden spoons and spatulas? Bake Snickerdoodle cupcakes, of course.  Because when is baking any more fun? (insert sarcastic chuckle here)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We love Snickerdoodle cookies at our house.  So these of course were a big hit.  And the combination of the moist cinnamon-y cupcake and the creamy cinnamon-y frosting is to DIE for.  Literally.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Have an awesome week.  And I will try to gain some of my sanity back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p><strong>Snickerdoodle Cupcakes w/Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting</strong><br />
makes 18 cupcakes</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups cake flour (or add 1 tablespoon cornstarch per 1 cup all purpose flour to make your own cake flour)<br />
1/2 tablespoon baking powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
1/2 tablespoon cinnamon<br />
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature<br />
1 cup sugar<br />
2 eggs<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla<br />
2/3 cup milk</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.  Set aside.  Using a mixer, cream the butter and sugar.  Add the eggs and vanilla.  Slowly add the flour and milk, alternating between the two until well incorporated.  Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl whenever needed.  Line a muffin pan with cupcake liners.  You will need 18.  Evenly distribute the batter between the cups.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 18-20 minutes.  Top with Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting and sprinkle a bit of cinnamon-sugar on top for extra prettiness.</p>
<p><strong>Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting</strong></p>
<p>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br />
4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature<br />
4 1/2 cups confectioners&#8217; sugar<br />
1/4 cup milk<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla<br />
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p>Cream the cream cheese and butter until creamy and smooth.  Add half the sugar, milk, vanilla and cinnamon.  Mix until smooth.  Add remaining sugar and beat until light and fluffy and creamy.</p>
<p><em>Happy Baking!</em></p>
<p>xoxo,<br />
